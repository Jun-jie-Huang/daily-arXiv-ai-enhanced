With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment. This survey provides a structured foundation for developing more realistic and comprehensive benchmarks for LLM-based code review."}

Beyond labels, the dataset includes rich temporal and behavioral metadata such as maintainer participation, code changes, and reopening patterns. Analyses show Intrinsic bugs resolve faster (median 8.9 vs 10.2 days), are close more often (92% vs 78%), and require code changes more frequently (57% vs 28%) compared to Extrinsic bugs.

While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs.\n  In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems."}

However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development."}

However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines."}

Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI."}

However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments. We implement VeriSBOM, analyze its security, and evaluate its performance on real-world package registries. The results show that our method enables scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable SBOM sharing and validation."}

This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks."}

However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability."}

We propose Agentic Requirement Compilation (ARC), a technique that moves beyond simple code generation to requirement compilation, enabling the creation of runnable web systems directly from multi-modal DSL documents. ARC generates not only source code but also modular designs for UI, API, and database layers, enriched test suites (unit, modular, and integration), and detailed traceability for software maintenance. Our approach employs a bidirectional test-driven agentic loop: a top-down architecture phase decomposes requirements into verifiable interfaces, followed by a bottom-up implementation phase where agents generate code to satisfy those tests. ARC maintains strict traceability across requirements, design, and code to facilitate intelligent asset reuse. We evaluated ARC by generating six runnable web systems from documents spanning 50-200 multi-modal scenarios. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ARC-generated systems pass 50.6% more GUI tests on average. A user study with 21 participants showed that novice users can successfully write DSL documents for complex systems, such as a 10K-line ticket-booking system, in an average of 5.6 hours. These results demonstrate that ARC effectively transforms non-trivial requirement specifications into maintainable, runnable software."}

The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments."}

Goal: This study aims to provide a longitudinal evaluation of GenAI's impact on agile software teams. We characterize its effect on developers' productivity by applying the multi-dimensional SPACE framework. Method: We conducted a multi-case longitudinal study involving 3 agile teams at a large technology consulting firm for around 13 months. We collected and compared quantitative telemetry (Jira, SonarQube, Git) and qualitative survey data from historical (pre-adoption) and research (post-adoption) sprints. Conclusion: GenAI tools can significantly improve team performance and well-being. Our key finding is a sharp increase in Performance and perceived Efficiency concurrent with flat developer Activity. This suggests GenAI increases the value density of development work, not its volume. This finding validates the necessity of multi-dimensional frameworks like SPACE to capture the true, nuanced impact of GenAI in situ, which would be invisible to studies measuring Activity alone."}

We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."}

We address these limitations by introducing risk aversion with respect to the initial population distribution and by incorporating bounded rationality to model deviations from fully rational decision-making agents. The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers."}

Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains.

Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes."}

[Objective & Method] This paper explores such practices, referred to as Constructive Patterns (CPs), from the perspective of early-career software engineers. Guided by Applicant Attribution-Reaction Theory, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews in which participants collectively described over 470 online R&S experiences. [Results] Through thematic analysis, we identified 22 CPs that reflect positive practices such as comprehensive and transparent job advertisements (CP01), specific and developmental feedback (CP03), humanized and respectful interaction (CP06), and framing the process as a two-way street (CP18).

Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications."}

The value of using simulation for this purpose is recognized in the literature, although achieving sufficient fidelity (i.e., the degree of similarity between the simulation and the real-world system) remains a challenging task. This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems. We argue that BDI developers should be able to test in simulation the same specification that will be later deployed, with no surrogate representations. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how the control flow of BDI agents can be mapped onto a Discrete Event Simulation (DES), showing that such integration is possible at different degrees of granularity. We substantiate our claims by producing an open-source prototype integration between two pre-existing tools (JaKtA and Alchemist), showing that it is possible to produce a simulation-based testing environment for distributed BDI} agents, and that different granularities in mapping BDI agents over DESs may lead to different degrees of fidelity."}

In this work, we propose FLIP (FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction), a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that reformulates reward modeling through backward inference: inferring the instruction that would most plausibly produce a given response. The similarity between the inferred and the original instructions is then used as the reward signal.

Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training. We further find that FLIP is particularly effective for longer outputs and robust to common forms of reward hacking. By explicitly exploiting the validation-generation gap, FLIP enables reliable reward modeling in downscaled regimes where judgment methods fail. Code available at https://github.com/yikee/FLIP."}

However, existing studies on code reasoning focus primarily on isolated code snippets, overlooking the complexity of real-world scenarios involving external API interactions and unfamiliar functions. This gap hinders our understanding of what truly makes code reasoning challenging for LLMs across diverse programming contexts.\n  We present CodeGlance, a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios: intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. Through systematic evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that unseen function reasoning poses significant challenges especially for smaller models, with Qwen2.5-3b achieving only 6.0\\% accuracy on unseen functions compared to 37.5\\% on familiar APIs. We identify critical code complexity features -- including execution trace length, API invocation count, and control flow complexity -- that significantly impact code reasoning difficulty across scenarios. We further investigate how common augmentation strategies, including CoT, document retrieval, and code search, can improve reasoning performance, finding that their effectiveness varies substantially depending on whether challenges stem from logical complexity or knowledge gaps. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing more capable code reasoning systems and deploying LLM-based programming assistants in real-world software development."}

Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis."}

To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance."}

Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible."}

This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality."}

While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse. This comparative multi-agent architecture represents a step towards scalable, theoretically informed computational tools capable of identifying rhetorical strategies in contemporary discourse."}

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI."}

The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05."}

It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings."}

To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance."}

Automated Code Revision Tools Against Semantics-Preserving Perturbations", "comment": null, "summary": "Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question."}

We address this by analyzing German and German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word use-to-sign ID mappings derived from 32 words from the German Word Usage Graph (D-WUG) and 49 signs from the Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language (DW-DGS).

A PR can be supported by a description, whose role has not yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of PR descriptions. We conducted a grey literature review of guidelines on writing PR descriptions and derived a taxonomy of eight recommended elements. Using this taxonomy, we analyzed 80K GitHub PRs across 156 projects and five programming languages to assess associations between these elements and code review outcomes (e.g., merge decision, latency, first response time, review comments, and review iteration cycles). To complement these results, we surveyed 64 developers about the perceived importance of each element. Finally, we analyzed which submission-time factors predict whether PRs include a description and which elements they contain. We found that developers view PR descriptions as important, but their elements matter differently: purpose and code explanations are valued by developers for preserving the rationale and history of changes, while stating the desired feedback type best predicts change acceptance and reviewer engagement. PR descriptions are also more common in mature projects and complex changes, suggesting they are written when most useful rather than as a formality."}

We identify eight configuration mechanisms and, in an empirical study of 2,926 GitHub repositories, examine whether and how they are adopted. We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature."}

Within the UG approach, the study considers Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (Lardiere, 2008, 2009) part of UG, focusing on the roles of first language (L1) transfer and L2 developmental influence. It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners."}

Towards Improving AI Agent Efficiency with Augmented MCP Tool Descriptions", "comment": null, "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.\n  To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs."}

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill."}

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the \"A+\" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini).

This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3. Notably, this yields up to an 8.1% increase in average throughput over EAGLE-3."}

Evidence increasingly shows they do not. We synthesize recent findings indicating that (i) safety guardrails weaken sharply on low-resource and code-mixed inputs, (ii) culturally harmful behavior can persist even when standard toxicity scores look acceptable, and (iii) English-only knowledge edits and safety patches often fail to carry over to low-resource languages. In response, we outline a practical agenda for researchers and students in the Global South: parameter-efficient safety steering, culturally grounded evaluation and preference data, and participatory workflows that empower local communities to define and mitigate harm. Our aim is to make multilingual safety a core requirement-not an add-on-for equitable AI in underrepresented regions."}

The dataset was annotated based on Arabic linguistic traditions and pragmatic theory, resulting in three classes: polite, impolite, and neutral. It contains 10,000 samples with linguistic feature annotations across 16 politeness categories and achieves substantial inter-annotator agreement (kappa = 0.703). We benchmark 40 model configurations, including traditional machine learning, transformer-based models, and large language models.

While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset. The set includes a standard RAG prompt, nine well-formed techniques from the literature, and 14 novel hybrid variants, all tested on two prominent SLMs: Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It. Our findings, based on a test set of 18720 instances, reveal significant performance gains of up to 83% on Qwen2.5 and 84.5% on Gemma3-4B-It, yielding an improvement of up to 6% for both models compared to the Standard RAG prompt. This research also offers concrete analysis and actionable recommendations for designing effective and efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems, practically for deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability. We present a new dataset derived from the CoMMA corpus and aligned with digitized Old French and Latin editions using passim. We also produce a manually corrected gold-standard evaluation set. We benchmark this resource using ByT5-based sequence-to-sequence models on normalization and pre-annotation tasks. Our contributions include the formal definition of PEN, a 4.66M-sample silver training corpus, a 1.8k-sample gold evaluation set, and a normalization model achieving a 6.7% CER, substantially outperforming previous models for this task."}

However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method."}

In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation."}

To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines. Building on this foundation, we integrate GRRM into the GRPO training loop to optimize the translation policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only improves general translation quality but also unlocks reasoning capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning models.

This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures."}

While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems."}

Existing Test Time Scaling (TTS) methods, including structured tree search, have made progress in exploring reasoning paths but still face two major challenges: (1) underthinking, where reasoning chains tend to be shallow and fail to capture the full complexity of problems; and (2) overthinking, where overly verbose reasoning leads to inefficiency and increased computational costs. To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogitsCoder produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to superior code generation performance compared to baseline methods."}

We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks. Finally, we instantiate OpenRS as reward supervision in pairwise RL training."}

We observe that stronger perturbations do not necessarily translate into more effective candidate trajectories, as unguided noise may disrupt internal decision structure rather than steer it. To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen. Experiments on GSM8K with two latent reasoning architectures show that GTS achieves more reliable inference-time scaling than heuristic baselines. These findings indicate that improving latent ITS requires structured and optimizable exploration mechanisms rather than simply amplifying stochasticity."}

We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode."}

Recent work has shown that encoder-decoder models can acquire irregular patterns, but evidence that they generalize these patterns like humans is mixed. We investigate this using the Spanish \\emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \\textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \\textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction."}

First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI."}

However, this \"pre-ingestion\" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the \"QA accuracy\" problem into a \"page localization\" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds."}

However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications."}

In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms.

By analyzing the static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models spanning encoder (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, ALBERT, MiniLM, DistilBERT) and decoder (GPT-2) architectures, we identify three operationally distinct hallucination types: Type 1 (center-drift) under weak context, Type 2 (wrong-well convergence) to locally coherent but contextually incorrect cluster regions, and Type 3 (coverage gaps) where no cluster structure exists. We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: α (polarity coupling), \\b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and λ_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (α > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing λ_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively. These findings establish the geometric prerequisites for type-specific hallucination detection and yield testable predictions about architecture-dependent vulnerability profiles."}

Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text.

A Case Study of Moltbook", "comment": null, "summary": "As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."}

To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval.

While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks."}

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations."}

We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems."}

We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization."}

However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA."}

We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation.

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."}

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms."}

Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning.

In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \\textbf{Grad}ient \\textbf{M}etric \\textbf{A}nd \\textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance.

In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\\times$ speedup) and performance."}

While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID."}

We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety."}

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers."}

Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance.

Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability).

Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation."}

Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance."}

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency."}

We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains. G2CP represents a fundamental shift from linguistic to structural communication in multi-agent systems, with implications for any domain requiring precise agent coordination. Code, data, and evaluation scripts are publicly available."}
