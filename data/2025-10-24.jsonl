However, finding test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely\nchallenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites\nover extended periods.\n  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between\nthe execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced\nafter testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions\nthat have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those\nmonitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases\nthat enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to\npinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and\naugments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.\n  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred\nopen-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates\nthat E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better\nthan state-of-the-art approaches.

This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically.

CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,\ndivergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty\nevaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.\nWe evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on\nCreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different\nmetrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary\nand open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly\ncorrelated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different\ndomains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong\ncorrelations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -\nwhereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings\nsupport our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or\ndimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for\na holistic evaluation of LLM creativity."}

To address this challenge, we\npropose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs\ntoken-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.\nInstead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a\nsequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating\nthese tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by\norders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination.

Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality\ndata effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.\nTo address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:\ndistilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and\ncoherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive\ndata construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing\nlow-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their\nhigh-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing\nsupervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement\nlearning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,\nsemantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments\nimperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for\nonly about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training\nbut also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods\nacross multiple benchmarks.

To study our steering\ntechnique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a\ntwo-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge\nnaturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual\ndescriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not\nduring deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation\ncue always means that it is being tested.

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,\nbecause the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs\ntend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual\nneeds. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead\nof forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific\npreference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related\npreferences to create a superior candidate pool.

These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility."}

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning\nunderperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and\nClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods\nserved as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in\ntoxicities.\n  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine\nlearning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small\ntraining data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare\ncategories.\n  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine\ntreatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong\npotential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance."}

We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored\nevaluation materials, tend to \"overthink\" simpler instances and have issues\nwith scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose\nto calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking\ntrajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this\napproach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving\nevaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement).

Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text.
