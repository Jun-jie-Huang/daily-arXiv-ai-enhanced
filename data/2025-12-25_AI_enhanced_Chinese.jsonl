In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u5404\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62e5\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b(POMDP)\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u662f\u5426\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAO-Agent\u7ed3\u5408DAO\u548c\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u94fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAO-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u4e0a\u7684DAO\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u900f\u660e\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u94fe\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\uff08ZKP\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0Shapley\u503c\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u94fe\u4e0a/\u94fe\u4e0b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u94fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDAO-Agent\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u4e0a\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1gas\u8d39\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8699.9%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e38\u6570\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DAO-Agent\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u81ea\u6cbb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6cbb\u7406\u4ee5\u53caZKP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6781\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u94fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236AgentReuse\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea630%\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u6587\u672c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgentReuse\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "AgentReuse\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u7387\uff0cF1\u5206\u65700.9718\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73870.9459\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8693.12%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentReuse\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u590d\u7528\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u52a9\u624b\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u56e0\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u4f01\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u6280\u672f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u56e0\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u9762\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u9610\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff08process analytics\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7.

We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLLMs\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8c03\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u9650\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u53ca\u5176\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528BigCodeBench (Hard)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u64cd\u63a7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cdLLMs\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u3002\u663e\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u66dd\u5149\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u6291\u5236\u8be5\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u70bc\u6700\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4f1a\u90e8\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002"}}

This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u521b\u9020\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bef\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Blooms\u8ba4\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b051\u79cd\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bef\u533a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bef\u533a\u3002"}}

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u9700\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8d25\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5224\u522b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u4e09\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u540e\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u591a\u5927\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5404\u56de\u5408\u56de\u7b54\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u5bfc\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5e08\uff0c\u4f46\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e0e\u590d\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u8f83\u957f\u4e14\u66f4\u6709\u793c\u8c8c\u3002\u91cd\u8ff0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ffd\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u793c\u8c8c\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u5219\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u590d\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u957f\u4e14\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3002"}}

Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f73\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4f17\u591a\u7684LLMs\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u6307\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u5219\u4fa7\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86ROME\u3001IKE\u548cWISE\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u2018\u9057\u5fd8\u2019\uff08unlearning\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4f17\u591a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982ROME\u3001IKE\u548cWISE\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u9650\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u56f4\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u9886\u57df\u5177\u5907\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u7cbe\u51c6\u754c\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u5185\u5bb9\u53ca\u907f\u514d\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9a\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u504f\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u53bb\u504f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6db5\u76d6\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728Gemma-2-9B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u201c\u5148\u9a8c\u5d29\u6e83\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u770b\uff0c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u81ea\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u65ad\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u53bb\u504f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u53bb\u504f\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities.

Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance.

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation.

Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models.

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMLP\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u7b49\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff08MLP\uff09\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u63a2\u9488\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u63a2\u9488\u63d2\u5165\u5c42\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LongFact\u3001HealthBench\u548cTriviaQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u53ca\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MLP\u63a2\u9488\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u5907\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8f85\u52a9\u201c\u601d\u8003\u7b26\u53f7\u201d\u6269\u5c55\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6559\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08reflection pretraining\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08Chain-of-Thought, CoT\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u5145\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each.

This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations.

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots).

Ma"], "title": "Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning.

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u71b5\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9a6c\u65af\u514b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a6c\u65af\u514b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u71b5\u6307\u6807\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u540e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u71b5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9a6c\u65af\u514b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}
