Benchmarking Vulnerability of Agent-Generated Code in Real-World Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684vibe coding\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740vibe coding\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u8feb\u5207\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SU S VI B E S\u57fa\u51c6\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b200\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ec510.5%\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Vibe coding\u4ea7\u51fa\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6b3e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cLLMs\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u8c03\u8bd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u8f85\u52a9\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Codeflaws\u3001Condefects\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684BugT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90LLMs\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u6b3e\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u4e03\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Codeflaws\u3001Condefects\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684BugT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5982OpenAI o3\u548cDeepSeekR1\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5982GPT-4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u624d\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u521d\u5b66\u8005\uff0cLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9886\u57df\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u8f85\u52a9\u4ef7\u503c\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7814SCA\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u5343\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u591a\u4e3a\u4f20\u9012\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e73\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u672a\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u76d1\u63a7\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ca\u52a0\u5feb\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93\u5e7f\u6cdb\u88ab\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u4ea7\u54c1\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5982Log4Shell\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7814\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ec4\u6210\u5206\u6790\uff08SCA\uff09\u5de5\u5177VODA\uff0c\u722c\u53d6\u4e86\u5305\u542bJava\u3001Python\u3001Rust\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u76841000\u591a\u4e2aGitHub\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u53ca\u51762013\u81f32023\u5e74\u7248\u672c\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5171\u7ea65\u4e07\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e93\u7248\u672c\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ca\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\u53ca\u53d1\u5e03\u5468\u671f\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e73\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u624d\u88ab\u4fee\u590d\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ca\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8f83\u96be\u53ca\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u4fee\u590d\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

It raises some risk factors for existing governance approaches as they remain fragmented: Existing frameworks are either static taxonomies driven; however, they lack an integrated end-to-end pipeline from risk identification to operational assurance, especially for an agentic platform. We propose AGENTSAFE, a practical governance framework for LLM-based agentic systems. The framework operationalises the AI Risk Repository into design, runtime, and audit controls, offering a governance framework for risk identification and assurance. The proposed framework, AGENTSAFE, profiles agentic loops (plan -> act -> observe -> reflect) and toolchains, and maps risks onto structured taxonomies extended with agent-specific vulnerabilities. It introduces safeguards that constrain risky behaviours, escalates high-impact actions to human oversight, and evaluates systems through pre-deployment scenario banks spanning security, privacy, fairness, and systemic safety. During deployment, AGENTSAFE ensures continuous governance through semantic telemetry, dynamic authorization, anomaly detection, and interruptibility mechanisms. Provenance and accountability are reinforced through cryptographic tracing and organizational controls, enabling measurable, auditable assurance across the lifecycle of agentic AI systems. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a unified governance framework that translates risk taxonomies into actionable design, runtime, and audit controls; (2) an Agent Safety Evaluation methodology that provides measurable pre-deployment assurance; and (3) a set of runtime governance and accountability mechanisms that institutionalise trust in agentic AI ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AGENTSAFE\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u5e93\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u8fd0\u8425\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAGENTSAFE\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u98ce\u9669\u5e93\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba1\u5212-\u884c\u52a8-\u89c2\u5bdf-\u53cd\u601d\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u9650\u5236\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u91cd\u8981\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6279\u3001\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6388\u6743\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u4e2d\u65ad\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faAGENTSAFE\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7ba1\u63a7\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4ef7\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "AGENTSAFE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Companion paper to \"The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems\". Code and tools: https://github.com/AerisSpace/EthicalEntropyKit", "summary": "Large language model safety is usually assessed with static benchmarks, but key failures are dynamic: value drift under distribution shift, jailbreak attacks, and slow degradation of alignment in deployment. Building on a recent Second Law of Intelligence that treats ethical entropy as a state variable which tends to increase unless countered by alignment work, we make this framework operational for large language models. We define a five-way behavioral taxonomy, train a classifier to estimate ethical entropy S(t) from model transcripts, and measure entropy dynamics for base and instruction-tuned variants of four frontier models across stress tests. Base models show sustained entropy growth, while tuned variants suppress drift and reduce ethical entropy by roughly eighty percent. From these trajectories we estimate an effective alignment work rate gamma_eff and embed S(t) and gamma_eff in a monitoring pipeline that raises alerts when entropy drift exceeds a stability threshold, enabling run-time oversight of value drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u71b5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u5982\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e2d\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e94\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5S(t)\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u6291\u5236\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u3002\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u7387\u03b3_eff\uff0c\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u548c\u03b3_eff\u5d4c\u5165\u76d1\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u4f26\u7406\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task.

Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.\n  Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.\n  Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings.

Current structured communication protocols such as direct agent-to-agent messaging or MCP-style tool calls offer reliability, but they struggle to support the emergent and swarm-like intelligence required in large adaptive systems. Distributed agents must learn continuously, share context fluidly, and coordinate without depending solely on central planners.\n  This paper revisits gossip protocols as a complementary substrate for agentic communication. Gossip mechanisms, long valued in distributed systems for their decentralized and fault-tolerant properties, provide scalable and adaptive diffusion of knowledge and fill gaps that structured protocols alone cannot efficiently address. However, gossip also introduces challenges, including semantic relevance, temporal staleness, and limited guarantees on action consistency in rapidly changing environments.\n  We examine how gossip can support context-rich state propagation, resilient coordination under uncertainty, and emergent global awareness. We also outline open problems around semantic filtering, trust, and knowledge decay. Rather than proposing a complete framework, this paper presents a research agenda for integrating gossip into multi-agent communication stacks and argues that gossip is essential for future agentic ecosystems that must remain robust, adaptive, and self-organizing as their scale and autonomy increase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06gossip\u534f\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u4e0d\u518d\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u7fa4\u96c6\u667a\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6gossip\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8865\u5145\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6269\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u534f\u540c\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "gossip\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u610f\u8bc6\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9648\u65e7\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "gossip\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While existing debiasing approaches primarily target demographic and social biases, methods for addressing cognitive biases in LLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first solution to address CSB through Reasoning Dependency Generation (RDG), a novel framework for generating unbiased reasoning data to mitigate choice-supportive bias through fine-tuning. RDG automatically constructs balanced reasoning QA pairs, explicitly (un)modeling the dependencies between choices, evidences, and justifications. Our approach is able to generate a large-scale dataset of QA pairs across domains, incorporating Contextual Dependency Data and Dependency Decouple Data. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on RDG-generated data demonstrate a 81.5% improvement in memory-based experiments and 94.3% improvement in the evaluation-based experiment, while maintaining similar performance on standard BBQ benchmarks.

These interactions are shaped by inherent differences in strength, and they often lead to stable dominance patterns that emerge surprisingly quickly relative to the size of the population. This motivates the search for simple mathematical models that capture both heterogeneous agent strength and rapid convergence to stable local dominance.\n  A widely studied abstraction of local dominance is the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. In the Luby MIS protocol that provably converges quickly to an MIS, each agent repeatedly generates a strength value chosen uniformly and becomes locally dominant if its value is smaller than those of its neighbors. This provides a theoretical explanation for fast dominance convergence in populations of equal-strength agents and naturally raises the question of whether fast convergence also holds in the more realistic setting where agents are inherently mixed-strength.\n  To investigate this question, we introduce the mixed-strength agents model, in which each agent draws its strength from its own distribution. We prove that the extension of the Luby MIS protocol where each agent repeatedly generates a strength value from its own distribution still exhibits fast dominance convergence, providing formal confirmation of the rapid convergence observed in many mixed-strength natural processes.\n  We also show that heterogeneity can significantly change the dynamics of the process. In contrast to the equal-strength setting, a constant fraction of edges need not be eliminated per round. We construct a population and strength profile in which progress per round is asymptotically smaller, illustrating how inherent strength asymmetry produces qualitatively different global behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u652f\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7684Luby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u4ecd\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u8d28\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5c40\u90e8\u652f\u914d\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u6837\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Luby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u9020\u7279\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u652f\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLuby \u6700\u5927\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6(MIS)\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4f46\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7136\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u652f\u914d\u6536\u655b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dLuby MIS\u534f\u8bae\u4f9d\u7136\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We introduce AsymPuzl, a minimal but expressive two-agent puzzle environment designed to isolate communication under information asymmetry. Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance.

Many Text2KG methods, however, rely on iterative LLM prompting, making them computationally expensive and prone to overlooking complex relations distributed throughout the text. To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k.

However, most existing resources assume a single generic audience, overlooking the wide variation in medical literacy and information needs across user groups. To address this limitation, we introduce PERCS (Persona-guided Controllable Summarization), a dataset of biomedical abstracts paired with summaries tailored to four personas: Laypersons, Premedical Students, Non-medical Researchers, and Medical Experts. These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research.

While scaling model size mitigates this \\citep{brown2020language}, the fundamental myopia of the NTP objective remains. In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time.

Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6HBLR\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u865a\u5047\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9636\u6bb5\u53ea\u8f6c\u6362\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u90e8\u5206\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u771f\u9012\u5f52\u9a8c\u8bc1\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u7ea0\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "HBLR\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \\textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters.

However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models.

Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks.

Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model.

To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain.

Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5404\u6709\u5229\u5f0a\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u91cf\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6458\u8981\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6ce8\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5bf98\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c3\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u57288\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e0d\u5177\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6458\u8981\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\u3002\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u672a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62bd\u8c61\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u662f\u4e07\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6709\u6548\u6458\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fe0\u5b9e\u538b\u7f29\u800c\u975e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning. On the other hand, TPTC adopts systematic decomposition of persuasive cues via a two-stage approach. Our evaluation suggests substantial improvement over underlying baselines in each case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d9\u4e8b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6INDI-PROP\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6FANTA\u548cTPTC\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5ba3\u4f20\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5ba3\u4f20\u4e2d\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u5de7\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u7ae0\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d9\u4e8b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1b\u5229\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bFANTA\u548cTPTC\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u805a\u7126\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u6c9f\u901a\u73b0\u8c61\u6574\u5408\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1266\u7bc7\u5173\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u5316\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08CAA\u548c\u519c\u6c11\u6297\u8bae\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53d9\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684FANTA\u548cTPTC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u5de7\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6c9f\u901a\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u8bf4\u670d\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684GPT\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u53ca\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5370\u5ea6\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5ba3\u4f20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u610f\u5927\u52291906\u540d\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aGenAI\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5224\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8001\u5e74\u5973\u6027\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\u7387\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7537\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u7d20\u517b\u867d\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u63aa\u65bd\u53ca\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u7d20\u517b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u51b5\u53ca\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf91906\u540d\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u65b0\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u63cf\u7ed8GenAI\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GenAI\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u79c1\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7d20\u517b\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u6570\u5b57\u7d20\u517b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u7d20\u517b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002"}}

Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6c34\u5229\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u5229\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b4000\u9898\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Hydro-SE Bench\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hydro-SE LLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Hydro-SE Bench\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u9053\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u5546\u4e1aLLMs\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57280.74\u81f30.80\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u57280.41\u81f30.68\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6c34\u5de5\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6c34\u5229\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e94\u7528LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u6c34\u5229\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u53c2\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement.

The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faESPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9010token\u6982\u7387\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4ftoken\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u578bRL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eELBO\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6bcftoken\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9010token\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eELBO\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ESPO\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4f5c\u5355\u4e00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528ELBO\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6bcftoken\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cESPO\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Countdown\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u534720-40\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "ESPO\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86dLLMs\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override.

Anglin", "Stephanie Milan", "Brittney Hernandez", "Claudia Ventura"], "title": "Improving Alignment Between Human and Machine Codes: An Empirical Assessment of Prompt Engineering for Construct Identification in Psychology", "comment": "22 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\u3002\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8c61\u6709\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u793a\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e0d\u5f53\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6784\u9020\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u793a\u4f8b\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u3002"}}

The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f7f\u5176\u9075\u5faa\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u533b\u5b66\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u5584\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u5b66\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u6545\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5b66LLM\u9075\u5faa\u5171\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u5357\u89c4\u5219\u53e3\u5934\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u8bc6\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity.

In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined.

To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.\n  This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u578bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u5230\u5148\u670d\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8bf7\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u786c\u4ef6\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4vLLM\u548cInferCept\uff0cAugServe\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53474.7-33.1\u500d\u548c3.3-13.2\u500d\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8696.3%\u548c95.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "AugServe\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models. Our work suggests that inductive biases learned prior to RL help models learn robust cognitive skill use.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkillFactory\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u6280\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cSkillFactory\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u6b65\u5b66\u4f1a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aRL\u73af\u8282\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e3a\u6280\u80fd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\"\u94f6\"\u6807\u51c6SFT\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faSkillFactory\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u505a\u51c6\u5907\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\"\u94f6\"\u6807\u51c6SFT\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SkillFactory\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5728RL\u9636\u6bb5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fd0\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
