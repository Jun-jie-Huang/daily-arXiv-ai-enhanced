Classical work by Holmstr\u00f6m established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases.

However, Python-based ABM frameworks face a fundamental tension between the accessibility that has made Python dominant in scientific computing and the performance requirements of large-scale simulations. This paper introduces AMBER, a framework that resolves this tension through a novel architectural approach: replacing the conventional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management using the Polars DataFrame library. We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations. Memory profiling reveals 30-50% reduction in peak usage compared to object-oriented frameworks.

While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \\textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains.

In this paper, \"fully generated\" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support.

To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance.

These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.\n  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage.

While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u53d1\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5e76\u53d1\u7f3a\u9677\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\u666e\u53ca\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e76\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u6b7b\u9501\uff09\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d658\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8de8\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u77ed\u8bed\u3001\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5339\u914d\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLM\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u7387\u8fbe91%-93%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e76\u53d1\u7f3a\u9677\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u878d\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u516c\u5f00\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Experimental study of decoding-time style control via n-gram logit injection", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically personalized via prompt engineering or parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA. However, writing style can be difficult to distill into a single prompt, and LoRA fine-tuning requires computationally intensive training and infrastructure. We investigate a possible lightweight alternative: steering a frozen LLM with n-gram style priors injected in logit space at decoding time. We train an n-gram model on stylistically distinct corpora -- including Don Quixote, CNN/DailyMail news headlines, and arXiv abstracts -- constructing an interpolated 1-to-3-gram prior over next-token probabilities. During generation we modify the LLM's logits by adding a weighted sum of style log-probabilities from each n-gram order that matches the current context, scaled by a control parameter lambda in [0, 1].\n  We sweep lambda and style corpora and report style perplexity under the n-gram model, base-model perplexity as a proxy for fluency, Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the original and steered token distributions, and token-overlap statistics. On TinyLlama-1.1B we identify a single narrow regime (for the Don Quixote corpus at lambda=0.1) where style perplexity improves by 24.7% and base-model perplexity improves by 51.4% relative to the frozen model. Outside this regime, and for multi-author corpora such as CNN/DailyMail and arXiv abstracts, even small nonzero lambda values generally result in worse style and fluency, and larger lambda values lead to collapse with extreme perplexities and incoherent text. Logit-space injection of n-gram style priors provides lightweight, tunable style control, but it is fragile: it operates effectively only within a narrow range of low lambda values and is consistently outperformed by prompting and LoRA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7logit\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165n-gram\u98ce\u683c\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u63d0\u793a\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5728logit\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165n-gram\u98ce\u683c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3n-gram\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u7684logits\u3002", "result": "\u5728TinyLlama-1.1B\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5728Don Quixote\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u4f4elambda\u503c\uff080.1\uff09\u65f6\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9lambda\u503c\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4f5c\u8005\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u900a\u8272\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "n-gram\u98ce\u683c\u5148\u9a8c\u7684logit\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548cLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs are best utilised as generators (teachers) rather than classifiers, producing data that empowers smaller and more efficient multilingual models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u539f\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u505a\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6559\u5e08\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u751f\u6210\u6db5\u76d611\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c4\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6216\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u6559\u5e08\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e2e\u52a9\u57f9\u517b\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002"}}

To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments.

This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare.

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering.

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation.

This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation. The study provides evidence that LLM-assisted assessment can be implemented at a national scale, even in a small-language context, while maintaining human oversight and compliance with emerging educational and regulatory standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5316\u8003\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6279\u6539\u5927\u91cf\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63a8\u8fdb\u7535\u5b50\u8003\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7231\u6c99\u5c3c\u4e9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8003\u4f5c\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b98\u65b9\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u7ec6\u5219\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1NLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b50\u9879\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5c0f\u8bed\u79cd\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u8003\u8bd5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u8003\u8bd5\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc4\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u843d\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5199\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.\n  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLuaJIT\u901a\u8fc7JIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Lua\u7684\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1C\u8bed\u8a00\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u8282\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u6839\u636e\u8054\u5408\u56fd2030\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5168\u7403\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002Lua\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u572825\u4e2a\u5b98\u65b9Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7248\u672c\u53caJIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "LuaJIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u5747\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u4f18LuaJIT\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5feb7\u500d\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c117\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63a5\u8fd1C\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "conclusion": "LuaJIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Lua\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1C\u8bed\u8a00\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ca\u65f6\u7f16\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications.

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements.

In this work, we study how large language models (LLMs) can simulate human action in the context of social dilemma games. While prior work has focused on \"steering\" (weak binding) of chat models to simulate personas, we analyze here how deep binding of base models with extended backstories leads to more faithful replication of identity-based behaviors. Our study has these findings: simulation fidelity vs human studies is improved by conditioning base LMs with rich context of narrative identities and checking consistency using instruction-tuned models. We show that LLMs can also model contextual factors such as time (year that a study was performed), question framing, and participant pool effects. LLMs, therefore, allow us to explore the details that affect human studies but which are often omitted from experiment descriptions, and which hamper accurate replication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e30\u5bcc\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7269\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u67e5\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u57fa\u7840\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u4e5f\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6c60\u7b49\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ed1\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5fb7\u56fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u5fb7\u56fd\u7279\u5b9a\u6cd5\u89c4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5c1a\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884c18\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5bf9109\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\u8c03\u8282\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u73af\u5883\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fb7\u56fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

Experiments with polymers have a long trial-and-error process, leading to long procedures and extensive resources. For these processes, machine learning has accelerated scientific discovery at the property prediction and latent space search fronts. However, laboratory researchers cannot readily access codes and these models to extract individual structures and properties due to infrastructure limitations. We present a closed-loop polymer structure-property predictor integrated in a terminal for early-stage polymer discovery. The framework is powered by LLM reasoning to provide users with property prediction, property-guided polymer structure generation, and structure modification capabilities. The SMILES sequences are guided by the synthetic accessibility score and the synthetic complexity score (SC Score) to ensure that polymer generation is as close as possible to synthetically accessible monomer-level structures. This framework addresses the challenge of generating novel polymer structures for laboratory researchers, thereby providing computational insights into polymer research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec8\u7aef\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cd\u590d\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fbf\u6377\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f85\u52a9\u805a\u5408\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5408\u6210\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u5f15\u5bfcSMILES\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5355\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec8\u7aef\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u4fee\u6539\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u79d1\u7814\u4eba\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u805a\u5408\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08REST API\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u5728\u63d0\u5347API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u4e25\u683c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8eREST API\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u5546\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u666e\u904d\u8fc7\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf916\u4f4d\u4e1a\u5185REST API\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5206\u6790API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f71\u54cdREST API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9075\u5b88\u7ea6\u5b9a\u6700\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u5339\u914d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u65b9\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "REST API\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u9075\u5b88\u7ea6\u5b9a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u666e\u904d\u62b5\u89e6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u968f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d1\u5c55\u800c\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers \"selectively skim\" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., \"focus on error handling\") as a hint to guide the pruning targets.

We propose a training-free framework for generation-time source attribution that leverages decoder attentions to directly cite supporting text spans or images, overcoming the limitations of post-hoc or retraining-based methods. We introduce two strategies for multimodal attribution: a raw image mode, which directly uses image patch attentions, and a caption-as-span mode, which substitutes images with generated captions to enable purely text-based alignment. Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines). Caption-based attribution achieves competitive performance with raw-image attention while being more lightweight and practical.

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8efoundation\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u914d\u7f6eC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u4fbf\u6377\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e00\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u56e0\u7279\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u6b3efoundation\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-OSS-20B\u548cGEMINI 3 PRO\uff09\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u6790\u5668TYPECHEF\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "GPT-OSS-20B\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff080.97\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff080.90\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.94\uff09\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc770%\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\uff0cCHATGPT-5.2\u51e0\u4e4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u4e3a\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8efoundation\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u914d\u7f6eC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In such cases, directly answering can lead to confident but incorrect predictions. We propose CoA(Clarify-or-Answer), an ask-or-answer agent that separately models the decision to ask or answer, and what to ask if needed. CoA first determines whether clarification is necessary; if so, it asks a single focused question and then incorporates the response to produce the final answer. We introduce CONTEXTCLARIFY with a set of ambiguous VQA questions and the contrast set that is non-ambiguous. We further introduce GRPO-CR (Clarification Reasoning), a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes clarification question generation with multiple reward signals encouraging well-formed, focused, non-trivial questions that resolve ambiguity.

Deciphering the Fate of AI-Generated Code in Open Source", "comment": "This paper has been submitted to EASE 2026 research track and currently under review", "summary": "The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u6d3b\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u201c\u53ef\u629b\u5f03\u201d\u3002\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u9898\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ba1\u7406\u800c\u975e\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5982\u4e1a\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u90a3\u6837\u662f\u201c\u53ef\u629b\u5f03\u201d\u7684\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9201\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc720\u4e07\u6bb5\u7531AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5355\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b58\u6d3b\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u957f\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u867d\u7136AI\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u6613\u88ab\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u5177\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u662f\u201c\u53ef\u629b\u5f03\u201d\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ba1\u7406\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature). Through case studies spanning instruction understanding, translation and in-context learning (ICL), we uncover interesting findings, such as when Jacobian Scopes point to implicit political biases.

While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9886\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\u9700\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u9762\u878d\u5408\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9065\u611f\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5237\u65b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u540e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\\% of the non-instrumented baseline.

However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic.

However, these impressive reasoning abilities face significant challenges in specialized domains. Taking Go as an example, although AlphaGo has established the high performance ceiling of AI systems in Go, mainstream LLMs still struggle to reach even beginner-level proficiency, let alone perform natural language reasoning. This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks. We perform mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data as a cold start, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate expert knowledge in Go with general reasoning capabilities. Through this methodology, we present \\textbf{LoGos}, a powerful LLM that not only maintains outstanding general reasoning abilities, but also conducts Go gameplay in natural language, demonstrating effective strategic reasoning and accurate next-move prediction. LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional players, substantially surpassing all existing LLMs. Through this work, we aim to contribute insights on applying general LLM reasoning capabilities to specialized domains.

Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PHISH\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8f93\u5165\u64cd\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u53d9\u4e8b\u6216\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u64cd\u63a7\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u63a8\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7528\u6237\u7aef\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5229\u7528PHISH\uff08Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9LLMs\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u63a7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u9010\u6b65\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u516b\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cPHISH\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u8f85\u5bfc\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u64cd\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u9760\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u53cc\u65b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b0\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u96be\u4ee5\u62b5\u6297\u6301\u7eed\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating knowledge from external sources, thereby providing credible evidence for scientific question answering. But existing retrieval and reranking methods remain vulnerable to passages that are semantically similar but logically irrelevant, often reducing factual reliability and amplifying hallucinations.To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Evidence Reranking Agent (DeepEra) that integrates step-by-step reasoning, enabling more precise evaluation of candidate passages beyond surface-level semantics. To support systematic evaluation, we construct SciRAG-SSLI (Scientific RAG - Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant), a large-scale dataset comprising about 300K SciQA instances across 10 subjects, constructed from 10M scientific corpus.

However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications. Furthermore, our 30B model trained with TL-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACS tasks under same simulation budget, demonstrating both strong generalization and practical utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f6c\u6298\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7TL-GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8f6c\u6298\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u6298\u7ea7\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "TL-GRPO\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7535\u8def\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f18\u5316\uff08ACS\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c30B\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TL-GRPO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f6c\u6298\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval.

Additionally, we develop the MRAG-Toolkit, facilitating systematic exploration of different RAG components. Our experiments reveal that: (a) RAG enhances LLM reliability across MRAG tasks.

However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content.

Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684RRC\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6838\u67e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22-\u7cbe\u70bc-\u6821\u51c6\uff08RRC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u7cbe\u70bc\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728HOVER\u548cFEVEROUS-S\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRRC\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0cRRC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency.

Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use.

Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts.

Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6297\u8c04\u5a9a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u3001MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528TruthfulQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8c04\u5a9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e2d\u5c42\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u4e14\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u201d\u65b9\u5411\u533a\u5206\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8c04\u5a9a\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0a\u53ef\u5206\u7684\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Evaluating Lower-dimensional Vectors for LLM Training Data Explanations", "comment": "8 pages", "summary": "Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u9009\u62e9\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u96c6\u591a\u51ed\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002"}}

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PLawBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPLawBench\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6db5\u76d6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5668\u5bf910\u4e2a\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "10\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5728PLawBench\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Rather than using a fixed set of questions, EMemBench generates questions from each agent's own trajectory, covering both text and visual game environments. Each template computes verifiable ground truth from underlying game signals, with controlled answerability and balanced coverage over memory skills: single/multi-hop recall, induction, temporal, spatial, logical, and adversarial. We evaluate memory agents with strong LMs/VLMs as backbones, using in-context prompting as baselines. Across 15 text games and multiple visual seeds, results are far from saturated: induction and spatial reasoning are persistent bottlenecks, especially in visual setting. Persistent memory yields clear gains for open backbones on text games, but improvements are less consistent for VLM agents, suggesting that visually grounded episodic memory remains an open challenge.

Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76.

Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models.

We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English).

In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text.

After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators.

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6b3e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u6587\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08T2I\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6587\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6171\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u621014\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u75287\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4f18\u5148\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u5728T2I\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4e0e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "T2I\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728Surface-over-Semantics\uff08\u8868\u9762\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6587\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5e94\u5f15\u8d77\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56fd\u9645\u8c61\u68cb\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6d41\u4f53\u667a\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a76\u7adf\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u662f\u6e90\u81ea\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u7ed3\u6676\u667a\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u591a\u5c11\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u6d41\u4f53\u667a\u529b\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fd\u9645\u8c61\u68cb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u68cb\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u6613\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2aGPT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u968f\u6d41\u4f53\u667a\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u9000\u5316\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u6b65\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u65ad\u867d\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u667a\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy.

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.

Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LogitMatch\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5411\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LogitMatch\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5fc5\u987b\u5339\u914d\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6587\u672c\u8de8\u5ea6\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u7c7b\u8de8\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u8de8\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLogitMatch\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LogitMatch\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u8de8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u8f93\u5165\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}
