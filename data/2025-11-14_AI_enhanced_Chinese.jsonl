Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6d41\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u6717\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30100\u4e2aPython\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u6613\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u6539\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8986\u76d6\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u6839\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002"}}

Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence.

Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation.

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u7eb3\u5165\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eISO/IEC 25010\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408108\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u4e24\u573a\u884c\u4e1a\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u6b3eLLMs\u4fee\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u732e\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u5173\u5fc3\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u3002\u5b58\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u5173\u6ce8\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u660e\u663e\u9519\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5165LLMs\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u66f4\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods.

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue.

While open-domain frameworks exist, applying them in private domains remains difficult due to heterogeneous tool formats, domain-specific jargon, restricted accessibility of APIs, and complex governance. Conventional solutions, such as fine-tuning on synthetic dialogue data, are burdensome and brittle under domain shifts, and risk degrading general performance. In this light, we introduce a framework for private-domain multi-agent conversational systems that avoids training and data generation by adopting behavior modeling and documentation. Our design simply assumes an orchestrator, a tool-calling agent, and a general chat agent, with tool integration defined through structured specifications and domain-informed instructions. This approach enables scalable adaptation to private tools and evolving contexts without continual retraining. The framework supports practical use cases, including lightweight deployment of multi-agent systems, leveraging API specifications as retrieval resources, and generating synthetic dialogue for evaluation -- providing a sustainable method for aligning agent behavior with domain expertise in private conversational ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79c1\u6709\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6587\u6863\u5316\u907f\u514d\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u79c1\u6709\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u5de5\u5177\u683c\u5f0f\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u9886\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u7279\u6b8a\u3001API\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u534f\u8c03\u8005\u3001\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u804a\u5929\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u652f\u6301\u79c1\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5229\u7528API\u89c4\u8303\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79c1\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\\% to 76.4\\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency.

We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bb9\u9519\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\uff08CP-WBFT\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MAS\u5728\u9ad8\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u6545\u969c\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CP-WBFT\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u654f\u9510\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9274\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488\u5f0f\u52a0\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCP-WBFT\u572885.7%\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u6545\u969c\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7CP-WBFT\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5bb9\u9519\u6027MAS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5bf9\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5916\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u662f\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TARG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8349\u7a3f\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6743\u8861\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u7f00logits\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u5747\u71b5\u3001top-1/top-2 logits\u5dee\u8ddd\u53d8\u6362\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u95e8\u9650\u65f6\u624d\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728NQ-Open\u3001TriviaQA\u548cPopQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTARG\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u59cb\u7ec8\u68c0\u7d22\u7684RAG\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8670-90%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TARG\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate.

The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations.

It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course.

The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness.

Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KC\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6807\u7b7e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8017\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u5bf9646\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u5197\u4f59\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u9608\u503c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u4ece569\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3428\uff0c\u6a21\u578bRMSE\u4ece0.4285\u4f18\u5316\u81f30.4259\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues.

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08Multilingual RAG\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08SCD\uff09\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u6e90\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5e72\u6270\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08SCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u8f7b\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance.

We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u8f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u54cd\u5e94\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGraphIF\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u56db\u9879\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u5747\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphIF\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u79d1\u7814\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u7f16\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd512\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u4e14\u8f83\u5c0f\uff088B\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8f83\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u7ed3\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path.

(2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark.

Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u793a\u8303\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\u504f\u597d\u5224\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u95ee\u9898-\u89e3\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff08OPS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5224\u5b9a\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684OPS\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6279\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bc4\u4ef7\u504f\u597d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ATR4CH\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u62bd\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u6b65\u6cd5\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6574\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e94\u6b65ATR4CH\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude Sonnet 3.7\u3001Llama 3.3 70B\u3001GPT-4o-mini\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u62bd\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5143\u6570\u636e\u62bd\u53d6\uff08F1 0.96-0.99\uff09\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08F1 0.7-0.8\uff09\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u62bd\u53d6\uff08F1 0.65-0.75\uff09\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u62bd\u53d6\uff08F1 0.95-0.97\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u540c\u6837\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ATR4CH\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u62bd\u53d6\u6811\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u548c\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TruthfulRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u590d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u53c2\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e TruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u662f\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility.

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts.

However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4\u548cLlama3\uff09\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e7\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5265\u79bb\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u9645\u7684LLMs\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08Chain of Thought\uff09\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684LLMs\uff08GPT-4\u548cLlama3\uff09\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1b\u800c\u65e7\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u521d\u671f\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6b65\u9aa4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u52a3\u52bf\u3002"}}

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LocalBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u53bf\u7ea7\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7ea614782\u5bf9\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b8f\u89c2\u5730\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8d85\u672c\u5730\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9700\u8981AI\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u793e\u533a\u7279\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6587\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1LocalBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b526\u4e2a\u53bf\u300149\u4e2a\u5dde\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u3001\u5730\u65b9\u8bba\u575b\u53ca\u5730\u533a\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u5e76\u572813\u6b3e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u5377\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec556.8%\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u4f4e\u4e8e15.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u5730\u7406\u6587\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5177\u5730\u65b9\u610f\u8bc6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7528\u6237\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u504f\u597d\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u589e\u957f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Mem0\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u524d30\u8f6e\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738770-82%\uff09\uff1b\u4f46\u5f53\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8d85\u8fc7150\u8f6e\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff1bMem0\u5728150\u8f6e\u4ee5\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0830-45%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56e0\u5176\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u5c3d\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u201c\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u201d\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e94\u5f97\u5230\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5957\u7528\u901a\u7528RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5207\u6362\u70b9\u3002"}}

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4f53\u88c1\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e0e\u6587\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f53\u88c1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\u6027\u522b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eAndrew Piper\u7684CONLIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Welch\u7684ANOVA\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u88c1\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u95f4\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u8c03\u8282\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e14\u5973\u6027\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u754c\u9650\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f53\u88c1\u5728\u6587\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u6587\u5b66\u548c\u4f53\u88c1\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u9020\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u5b66\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u660e\u663e\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart.

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality.

The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value.

Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines.

In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation.

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5ParoQuant\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u901a\u9053\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParoQuant\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u72ec\u7acbGivens\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u7ec4\u5185\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u5747\u8861\u901a\u9053\u5e45\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5171\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528GPU\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "ParoQuant\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4AWQ\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\u3002", "conclusion": "ParoQuant\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5176\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}
