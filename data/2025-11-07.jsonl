Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that\nRAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,\nand runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair\nstrategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging\ntools to under-studied languages."}

Yet this assumption remains largely untested.\nExisting validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --\ntesting whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence\nthat such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the\nliterature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:\noptimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and\nvice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for\nvalidation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note\nabout their current limitations in capturing human communication."}

This study investigates how closely LLMs' value\npreferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample\nand AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key\nresponsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)\nresolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software\nrequirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally\nalign more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative\nsample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and\naccountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs\nclaim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),\nrevealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior.

Model performance was evaluated on test\nsets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level\nPHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI\ngeneration using a \"hide-in-plain-sight\" method and (2) performance against\ncommercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all\nPHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the\nPenn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining\nthe previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation\nshowed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50\nindependently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor\nsystems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).\nDiscussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional\ngeneralization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility\nwhile ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model\ntrained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial\nsystems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical\ntext processing."}

As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit.

Based on the analysis of\nprompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding\nthat text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the\nsource CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by\nthis finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate\nthem via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based\nLLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.\nLater improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified\ncandidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round\nsimplification performance."}

Existing\nevaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to\ncapture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge\napproaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper\nintroduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for\nthe rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an\nagentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)\ndatasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to\nensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge\nmetrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to\nachieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to\nevaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military\noperations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is\nhighly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter\nconfiguration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis\non the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG.

Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent\nor simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part\nframework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,\nLLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding\nto a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit\nuncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds\ncharacteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for\n14 common diagnoses.

To test\nthis hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language\nmodel's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we\nfind a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,\nand how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This\nsuggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are\nalternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet\ncommitted to a particular final answer.
