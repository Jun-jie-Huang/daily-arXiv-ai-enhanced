Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes. To this end, we introduce SpackIt, an end-to-end framework that combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement through diagnostic feedback. We apply SpackIt to a representative subset of 308 open-source HPC packages to assess its effectiveness and limitations. Our results show that SpackIt increases installation success from 20% in a zero-shot setting to over 80% in its best configuration, demonstrating the value of retrieval and structured feedback for reliable package synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpackIt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684Spack\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u88c5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u6784\u5efa\u89c4\u8303\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5982Spack\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u914d\u65b9\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u914d\u65b9\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpackIt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u793a\u4f8b\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u8bca\u65ad\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6210Spack\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728308\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90HPC\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSpackIt\u5c06\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b89\u88c5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece20%\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u768480%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Developers often write low-quality code due to factors like technical knowledge gaps, insufficient experience, time pressure, management decisions, or personal factors. Once integrated, the accumulation of this suboptimal code leads to significant maintenance costs and technical debt.\n  Developers frequently consult external knowledge bases, such as API documentation and Q&A websites like Stack Overflow (SO), to aid their programming tasks. SO's crowdsourced, collaborative nature has created a vast repository of programming knowledge. Its community-curated content is constantly evolving, with new answers posted or existing ones edited.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study of SO Java answer edits and their application to improving code in open-source projects. We use a modified code clone search tool to analyze SO code snippets with version history and apply it to open-source Java projects. This identifies outdated or unoptimized code and suggests improved alternatives. Analyzing 140,840 Java accepted answers from SOTorrent and 10,668 GitHub Java projects, we manually categorized SO answer edits and created pull requests to open-source projects with the suggested code improvements. Our results show that 6.91% of SO Java accepted answers have more than one revision (average of 2.82).

Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b83\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9Token\u8868\u793a\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio-Edit\u3002", "result": "Ming-UniAudio\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d8\u9879\u6307\u6807\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\u4efb\u52a1\u7684Seed-TTS-WER\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u81ea\u7531\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite the demonstrated success of previous Web API recommendation solutions, two critical challenges persist: 1) a fixed top-N recommendation that cannot accommodate the varying API cardinality requirements of different mashups, and 2) these methods output only ranked API lists without accompanying reasons, depriving users of understanding the recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification. WAR-Re leverages special start and stop tokens to handle the first challenge and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the model's ability in both tasks. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WAR-Re achieves a gain of up to 21.59\\% over the state-of-the-art baseline model in recommendation accuracy, while consistently producing high-quality semantic reasons for recommendations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684Web API\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5WAR-Re\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9aTop-N\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dWeb API\u63a8\u8350\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "WAR-Re\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u6b8a\u8d77\u6b62\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u53d8\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ProgrammableWeb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWAR-Re\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b21.59%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u8350\u7406\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "WAR-Re\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Web API\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86Web API\u63a8\u8350\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a5\u9001\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u51c6STAIR\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6b3a\u9a97\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u76d1\u63a7\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u51c6STAIR\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u961f\u8bba\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u6613\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u8fd0\u7b97\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u62d2\u7edd\u8bf7\u6c42\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea6\u675f\u7f13\u89e3\u9000\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u51fa\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86STAIR\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u62d2\u7edd\u8bf7\u6c42\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u9000\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "STAIR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u63a5\u9001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks.

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

We present MCP4IFC, a comprehensive open-source framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly manipulate Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The framework provides a set of BIM tools, including scene querying tools for information retrieval, predefined functions for creating and modifying common building elements, and a dynamic code-generation system that combines in-context learning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle tasks beyond the predefined toolset.

The system supports a variety of programming languages, integrates debugging tasks and data acquisition functions, captures students' debugging behavior in the local editor in real time, and uploads the data to the platform database to realize the whole process monitoring and feedback, provides accurate debugging guidance for teachers, and improves the teaching effect. In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis. Through several practical teaching tests, the feasibility and stability of the system are verified, which proves that it can effectively support procedural evaluation in programming debugging teaching, and provides a new direction for debugging behavior analysis research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eVS Code\u63d2\u4ef6\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u8c03\u8bd5\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5168\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u8c03\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u5206\u6790\u8c03\u8bd5\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6559\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eVS Code\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5b66\u751f\u8c03\u8bd5\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4e0a\u4f20\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc6\u522b\u53ca\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u8c03\u8bd5\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u8c03\u8bd5\u8def\u5f84\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6587\u4ef6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u8df5\u6559\u5b66\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8c03\u8bd5\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8c03\u8bd5\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u51c6\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlowMM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5254\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u4e22\u5f03\u5173\u952eKV\u5bf9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u9057\u5931\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709KV\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "FlowMM\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee4\u724c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFlowMM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680%\u81f395%\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u548c1.3\u52301.8\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6709\u529b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \\textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency.

Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fb5\u8680\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u201c\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75282013\u81f32025\u5e74\u82f1\u6587\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u7684Common Crawl\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u53ca\u524d\u7f13\u6162\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u65e9\u671fRNN/LSTM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u53ca\u540e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u4f7f\u7528AI\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u9762\u4e34\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity of labeled logs limits rapid deployment to new systems. Cross-system transfer has become an important research direction. State-of-the-art approaches perform well with a few labeled target logs, but limitations remain: small-model methods transfer general knowledge but overlook mismatches with the target system's proprietary knowledge; LLM-based methods can capture proprietary patterns but rely on a few positive examples and incur high inference cost. Existing LLM-small model collaborations route 'simple logs' to the small model and 'complex logs' to the LLM based on output uncertainty. In zero-label cross-system settings, supervised sample complexity is unavailable, and such routing does not consider knowledge separation. To address this, we propose GeneralLog, a novel LLM-small model collaborative method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection. GeneralLog dynamically routes unlabeled logs, letting the LLM handle 'proprietary logs' and the small model 'general logs,' enabling cross-system generalization without labeled target logs.

AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic operational conditions.\n  To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software, the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and execution modes.\n  Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their lower computational demands.

Calmon"], "title": "Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability", "comment": "23 Pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens.

By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRust\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u6162\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u5feb\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u6210Rust\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53473-4\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u79d2\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177FANDANGO-RS\u80fd\u591f\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u4e3aC\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u751f\u6210401\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Considering the worsening global climate change, a transition of current industrial processes is necessary to tackle the above-mentioned factors. To address this urgent issue, socio-economic systems like the Circular Economy (CE) provide options to reallocate the use of resources and products on a global scale. Especially in terms of product lifecycle-prolonging, this system provides suitable approaches to alter the current modes of product handling by society and industry alike, based on the condition of the products. Although the importance and benefits of sustainable services enabling these options are widely known, users tend to shy away from using them. One of the reasons is the missing reliability in terms of the knowledge of the costs associated with a particular service. This uncertainty in expected pricing can, therefore, lower the willingness of potential clients. However, not only clients struggle with the boundary conditions of such services. On the part of the potential providers of services, the monetary risk is often caused by the incapability to detect the condition of a product in advance. This can result on the provider side in a severe economic loss if this possibility is not covered by the service price or through the mass of items, which could allow equalization of serval service operations. To address these weak points in current service execution, the authors propose the \\textit{Lifecycle Workbench (LCW)}-ecosystem, which features digital representations to enhance the reliability of service pricing as well as the assessment of the condition of items, assemblies, and parts in the Circular Economy domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7535\u5668\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u6fc0\u589e\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u51b5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5668\u4ea7\u54c1\u5927\u91cf\u751f\u4ea7\u5e26\u6765\u8d44\u6e90\u67af\u7aed\u548c\u73af\u5883\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u56e0\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u72b6\u51b5\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\uff08LCW\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4ea7\u54c1\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u96f6\u4ef6\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LCW\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u5ef6\u957f\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u6548\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5de5\u5177\uff0cLCW\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u670d\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits. We release the benchmark and accompanying data pipeline to facilitate research on automated performance engineering and long-horizon software reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SWE-fficiency\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u4f4d\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u51c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u957f\u8fdc\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b498\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548cHPC\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4eceGitHub PR\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u8ba4\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u4e0d\u52300.15\u500d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u70b9\u3001\u8de8\u51fd\u6570\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u8fdc\u8f6f\u4ef6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute). We briefly outline the main contributions of each of the selected literature reviews. In the collected studies, we observed a broad coverage of software product quality, although frequently accompanied by notes on how much more empirical research is needed to further validate existing claims.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBACo\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u9020\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "BACo\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u5c42\u9762\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7531\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u800c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "BACo\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c13\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b021.3%\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4ea6\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u590d\u6742\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback.\n  Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax.\n  Conclusions: The context provided by the model and language key may mitigate the i* symbol recognition deficit reported in previous works.

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply.

In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities.

This study conducts an empirical analysis of 200 open-source Android projects written in Java and Kotlin to diagnose and resolve build failures. Through a five-phase process encompassing data collection, build execution, failure classification, repair strategy design, and LLM-assisted evaluation, we identified four primary types of build errors: environment issues, dependency and Gradle task errors, configuration problems, and syntax/API incompatibilities. Among the 135 projects that initially failed to build, our diagnostic and repair strategy enabled developers to resolve 102 cases (75.56%), significantly reducing troubleshooting effort.

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) automate UI-to-Code generation, they generate only static HTML/CSS/JavaScript layouts lacking interactivity. To address this, we propose WebVIA, the first agentic framework for interactive UI-to-Code generation and validation. The framework comprises three components: 1) an exploration agent to capture multi-state UI screenshots; 2) a UI2Code model that generates executable interactive code; 3) a validation module that verifies the interactivity. Experiments demonstrate that WebVIA-Agent achieves more stable and accurate UI exploration than general-purpose agents (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). In addition, our fine-tuned WebVIA-UI2Code models exhibit substantial improvements in generating executable and interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript code, outperforming their base counterparts across both interactive and static UI2Code benchmarks.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DRAGON\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u6709\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRAGON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u6307\u4ee4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DRAGON\u7684\u5f3a\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u826f\u597d\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53ca\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5220\u9664\u6709\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u5b58\u6216\u5220\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u90fd\u662f\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u82e5\u5148\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MEMIT, AlphaEdit\uff09\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u3001LoRA\u3001DoRA\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5171\u8ba1232\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u5b58\u7eed\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0cAlphaEdit\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u7565\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u6613\u635f\u5bb3\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u5e94\u8986\u76d6\u5b8c\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e0e\u5220\u9664\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u53d1\u73b0\uff08NID\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NILC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684NID\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u6587\u672c\u518d\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e24\u6b65\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "NILC\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5bf9\u96be\u5206\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u805a\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNILC\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NILC\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfNID\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Results: We identified the benefits (e.g., maintain software development flow, improve developers' mental model, and foster entrepreneurship) and disadvantages (e.g., negative impact on developers' personality and damage to developers' reputation) of using LLMs at individual, team, organisation, and society levels; as well as best practices on how to adopt LLMs. Conclusion: Critically, we present the trade-offs that software practitioners, teams, and organisations face in working with LLMs. Our findings are particularly useful for software team leaders and IT managers to assess the viability of LLMs within their specific context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\u53ca\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u867d\u6709LLMs\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5176\u6b63\u8d1f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc722\u6b21\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\uff08STGT\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u5229\u5f0a\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u548c\u521b\u4e1a\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u53ca\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6027\u683c\u548c\u58f0\u8a89\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u6700\u4f73\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f6f\u4ef6\u56e2\u961f\u53ca\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u5e94\u7528LLMs\u65f6\u9700\u6743\u8861\u5229\u5f0a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u56e2\u961f\u9886\u5bfc\u548cIT\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u65b0\u589e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u65b0\u589e\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7ea7\u904d\u5386\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5c42\u6b21\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bRL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5c42\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aRL\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u904d\u5386\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6539\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

The identification of loop invariants is a critical step to support automated program safety assessment. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in diverse software engineering (SE) and formal verification tasks. However, we are not aware of the performance of LLMs to infer loop invariants. We report an empirical study of both open-source and closed-source LLMs of varying sizes to assess their proficiency in inferring inductive loop invariants for programs and in fixing incorrect invariants. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some utility in inferring and repairing loop invariants, their performance is substantially enhanced when supplemented with auxiliary information such as domain knowledge and illustrative examples. LLMs achieve a maximum success rate of 78\\% in generating, but are limited to 16\\% in repairing the invariant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8678%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ec5\u4e3a16%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u662f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63a8\u65ad\u5f52\u7eb3\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a78%\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u4ec516%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering. PhaseSeed provides up to 92.6% precision improvement for CFI compared to static call graph construction techniques, and filters nine additional security-critical system calls when used to generate Seccomp profiles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhaseSeed\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "PhaseSeed\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6307\u9488\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79cd\u5b50\u8f93\u5165\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6280\u672f\uff0cPhaseSeed\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u9ad892.6%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Seccomp\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u591a\u8fc7\u6ee49\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "PhaseSeed\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u5177\u6709\u5065\u58ee\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce the Research monad, a Haskell eDSL that enforces sequential statistical protocols (e.g., Online FDR (false discovery rate) control) using a monad transformer stack. To address risks in hybrid architectures where LLMs generate imperative code, we employ Declarative Scaffolding -- generating rigid harnesses that structurally constrain execution and prevent methodological errors like data leakage.

However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations.

The use of outdated OSS libraries introduces technical lag, necessitating timely upgrades. However, maintaining up-to-date libraries is challenging, as it may introduce incompatibility issues that break the project or redundant dependencies that unnecessarily increase the size of the project. These issues discourage developers from upgrading libraries, highlighting the need for a fully automated solution that balances version upgrades, reduces technical lag, ensures compatibility, and avoids redundant dependencies.\n  To this end, we propose DepUpdater, which ensures that upgrades minimize technical lag as much as possible while avoiding incompatibility issues and redundant dependencies. The comparison with existing dependency management tools demonstrates that DepUpdater more effectively reduces technical lag while ensuring compatibility and pruning redundant dependencies. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the potential benefits of considering pruning requirements during upgrades to mitigate incompatibility issues.

Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Data is often siloed across numerous disparate tools, making manual report generation time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a centralized framework designed to provide near-real-time visibility into developer experience (DevEx) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics for a software ecosystem. By aggregating data from various internal tools and platforms, the system computes and visualizes metrics across key areas such as Developer Productivity, Quality, and Operational Efficiency. The architecture features a cron-based data ingestion layer, a dual-schema data storage approach, a processing engine for metric pre-computation, a proactive alerting system, and utilizes the open-source BI tool Metabase for visualization, all secured with role-based access control (RBAC). The implementation resulted in a significant reduction in manual reporting efforts, saving an estimated 20 person-hours per week, and enabled faster, data-driven bottleneck identification.

Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management.

Any-Logic simulation software was used to mimic the model realism in a virtual environment.

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. (1) Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. (2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.\n  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.\n  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ContextCRBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9876\u7ea7\u4ed3\u5e93\u722c\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u548cPR\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e8667910\u6761\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u5757\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u884c\u7ea7\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u884c\u7ea7\u8bc4\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u591a\u6b3e\u9886\u5148\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5df2\u5728\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd61.98%\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u7cd9\u7b49\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u91cd\u5927\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaContextCRBench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u722c\u53d6153.7K\u6761\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u751f\u621067910\u6761\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6837\u672c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u8bc4\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u5757\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u884c\u7ea7\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u884c\u7ea7\u8bc4\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e868\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u540e\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534761.98%\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextCRBench\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5316\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReMoD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0cReMoD\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u7acb\u573a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5305\u542bModality Experience Pool\u548cSemantic Experience Pool\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c60\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00MMSD\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cReMoD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

All datasets and models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/s-emanuilov/licensing-oracle-experiments", "summary": "Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines.

To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions.

This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TimeSense\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b10\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684EvalTS\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u91cd\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimeSense\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u91cd\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTimeSense\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeSense\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types.

GitHub: https://github.com/czi-ai/DrugMechCounterfactuals", "summary": "Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u7269\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\uff08\u9700\u56de\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "o4-mini\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI\u7684o4\u3001o3\u53cao3-mini\u6a21\u578b\uff0cQwen3-4B-thinking\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8ao4-mini\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u94fe\u8def\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL.

Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs.

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest.

The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality.

More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings.

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design.

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\".

The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination.

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u5230\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff08DIA-REFINE\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u65b9\u8a00\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u514b\u670dN-gram\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u5230\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u7684N-gram\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u504f\u5411\u6e90\u8bed\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIA-REFINE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u65b9\u8a00\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff08DFS\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u8a00\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08TDR\uff09\u4e24\u9879\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u97e9\u8bed\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDIA-REFINE\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u533a\u522b\u771f\u5047\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4f20\u7edfN-gram\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u4f46\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DIA-REFINE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc(TSAN)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u5355\u4e00\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u4e0d\u540c\u56de\u7b54\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u8bed\u6c14\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "TSAN\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u503c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4e09\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cTSAN\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u8bf8\u5982Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\u7b49\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TSAN\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf923\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\uff082.7\u4ebf\u81f340\u4ebf\uff09\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u8bed\u6cd5\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u8bcd\u5e8f\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u65e0\u5173\u53ca\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u7b54\uff09\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8986\u76d625%\u300150%\u300175%\u3001100%\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u6cd5\u6c61\u67d3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u9020\u6210\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\u4e14\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u201c\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672a\u5fc5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u6cd5\u6c61\u67d3\u5f02\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u6c61\u67d3\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SafeNlidb\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eSQL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u635f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eSQL\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u504f\u597d\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6SQL\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length.

These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \\textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \\emph{\\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \\emph{\\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer.

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines.

This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u826f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8f83\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u3002"}}

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RPTS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b374\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u548c390\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636eRPTS-Eval\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u6d4b\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6216\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u8003\u5bdf\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807RPTS\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6811\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8d4b\u4e88\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u73af\u8282\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684RPTS-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528RPTS\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT4o\u3001Llava-Next\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RPTS\u53caRPTS-Eval\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding.

Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \\textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin. We release LMT in four sizes (0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B) to catalyze future research and provide strong baselines for inclusive, scalable, and high-quality MMT \\footnote{\\href{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LMT\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u5957\u4ee5\u4e2d\u82f1\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u3001\u8986\u76d660\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c234\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5747\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5411\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u5411\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u9000\u5316\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u201d\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u201c\u5e76\u884c\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u201d\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u8bed\u8a00\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5212\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\uff0cLMT\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c4B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Aya-101-13B\u548cNLLB-54B\u7b49\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LMT\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7248\u672c\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.\n  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u5370\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684judge-corrector\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5bf9IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u8fd12.9\u4e07\u6761\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e8617.1%\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540eBLEU\u5206\u6570\u5728\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u53ca\u6311\u6218\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u82f1\u8bd1\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u62c9\u96c5\u62c9\u59c6\u8bed\u53ca\u5965\u91cc\u4e9a\u8bed\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86RADAR-MDD\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53e3\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u67097\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u590d\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790UK\u3001\u8377\u5170\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259586\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u76845,836\u6761\u8bed\u97f3\u5f55\u97f3\u548cPHQ-8\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u72b6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u5b50\u8bcd\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u9762\u8bcd\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u9700\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics.

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u5f31\u70b9\u503c\uff08MIWV\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u9009\u62e9Top 1%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u5c11\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97MIWV\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6311\u9009\u6700\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6309\u7167MIWV\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u524d1%\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MIWV\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MIWV\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff08EBM-CoT\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u7684token\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u9690\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53d1\u6563\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8d8b\u5411\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6821\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cEBM-CoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EBM-CoT\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals.

Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings.

In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present.

Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision.

As part of the \"Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification\" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team \"Retriv\" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C).

While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents.

RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques.

In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs.

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5207\u7ebf\u6838\uff08NTK\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5207\u7ebf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u7531\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9009\u53d6\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3NTK\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NTK-Selector\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u9009\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team \"Retriv\" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934.

The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u534f\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0\uff08SAOP\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u7684\u624b\u773c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0d\u88ab\u6253\u6270\u5730\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u6821\u9a8c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u64cd\u7eb5CT\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u4e09\u7ef4\u89e3\u5256\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u534f\u8c03\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff08MOEM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728240\u6761\u8bed\u97f3\u6307\u4ee4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSAOP\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5e73\u53f0\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies.

Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks.

We investigate whether agents can collaborate in fraudulent behaviors, how such collaboration amplifies risks, and what factors influence fraud success. To support this research, we present MultiAgentFraudBench, a large-scale benchmark for simulating financial fraud scenarios based on realistic online interactions. The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level.
