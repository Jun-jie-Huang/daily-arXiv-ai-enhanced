This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics. We propose practical recommendations for instructors and student teams adopting agile methods in hybrid, project-based learning settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u516b\u4eba\u5b66\u751f\u56e2\u961f\u4e3a\u671f\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Scrum\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u5c11\u5173\u4e8eScrum\u7b49\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9879\u76ee\u53ca\u53d7\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u9650\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u6027\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001Discord\u3001Notion\u548cGitHub\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8d21\u732e\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u77ed\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0e\u4eea\u5f0f\u8c03\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u52a8\u529b\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u77ed\u5468\u671f\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b66\u751f\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bdScrum\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens.

Will be published at ACL anthology", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories.

However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6b7b\u9501\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eQ\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PC2P\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4eba\u7fa4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6b7b\u9501\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PC2P\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9876\u5c16\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PC2P\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u57df\u6b7b\u9501\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBootTrans\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6c60\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u8de8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9762\u4e34\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBootTrans\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u67a2\u8f74\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u79cd\u5b50\u6c60\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6c60\u7684\u53cc\u6c60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6267\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u5411\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEval-X\u548cTransCoder-Test\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cBootTrans\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u5411\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BootTrans\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bd5\u70b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MAS\u7684\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u9057\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u4e09\u5927\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u8bd5\u70b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u77ed\uff0c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u539f\u578b\u5411\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fce\u5408\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9022\u8fce\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u800c\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u9022\u8fce\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9022\u8fce\u6027\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\u611f\u800c\u975e\u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ec5\u9760\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u6d88\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CAP-GSM8K\u5bf9\u6297\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4o\u548cGPT-5.1\uff09\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\uff08RCA\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u5bf9\u9022\u8fce\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u4e14\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u7ea611.4%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\u5219\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u9022\u8fce\u884c\u4e3a\uff080.0%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u8fce\u5408\u7528\u6237\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u9022\u8fce\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.\n  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.\n  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Deploy-Master\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6db5\u76d6\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6db5\u76d690\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece50\u4e07\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u7ea65.2\u4e07\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u6784\u5efa\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u5185\u5b8c\u62105.2\u4e07\u4e2a\u6784\u5efa\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa5\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6ce8\u518c\u4e8eSciencePedia\u4f9b\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "Deploy-Master\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf95\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm.

A Study of Tests in Agentic Pull Requests", "comment": null, "summary": "Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs.

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9690\u853d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6218\u7565\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u800c\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9690\u79d8\u3001\u66f4\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e92\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u53ca\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2a\u6027\u53ca\u5355\u6b21\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u6d41\u6216\u4ea4\u6d41\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u6839\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u9690\u853d\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u8c03\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u6218\u7565\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u51fa\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u53ca\u6e38\u620f\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5.

This paper presents \\textit{VSM--GQM--DevOps}, a unified, traceable framework that integrates (i) Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to visualize the end-to-end delivery system and quantify delays, rework, and handoffs, (ii) the Goal--Question--Metric (GQM) paradigm to translate stakeholder objectives into a minimal, decision-relevant measurement model (combining DORA with project and team outcomes), and (iii) maturity-aligned DevOps automation to remediate empirically observed bottlenecks through small, reversible interventions. The framework operationalizes traceability from observed waste to goal-aligned questions, metrics, and automation candidates, and provides a defensible prioritization approach that balances expected impact, confidence, and cost. We also define a multi-site, longitudinal mixed-method validation protocol that combines telemetry-based quasi-experimental analysis (interrupted time series and, where feasible, controlled rollouts) with qualitative triangulation from interviews and retrospectives. The expected contribution is a validated pathway and a set of practical instruments that enables organizations to select automation investments that demonstrably improve both delivery performance and project-management outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u76ee\u6807-\u95ee\u9898-\u5ea6\u91cf\u548cDevOps\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u6210\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6218\u7565\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4ed8\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u5ba2\u6237\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684VSM-GQM-DevOps\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\uff08VSM\uff09\u3001\u76ee\u6807-\u95ee\u9898-\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08GQM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u7684DevOps\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e2d\u7684\u6d6a\u8d39\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u9006\u5e72\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u53d1\u73b0\u6d6a\u8d39\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u3001\u7eb5\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u9065\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u8d28\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u6548\u679c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u4ed8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.\n  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPT-5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5949\u627f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "GPT-5\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u667a\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "GPT-5\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u9632\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "GPT-5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5ba1\u614e\u7b56\u7565\u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations?

However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning.

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states.

However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.\n  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.\n  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage.

However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.\n  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u6216\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840LLM\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6X\u5149\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a213GPP\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8690%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5386\u53f2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups.

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions.

However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.\n  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.\n  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test.

These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9OT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u96be\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCSRO\u672c\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5728OT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u6743\u9650\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u63a5\u53e3\u6216\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bb9\u5668\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u91cd\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002OT\u5bb9\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34IT/OT\u67b6\u6784\u6df7\u5408\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u6563\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u672c\u4f53\uff08CSRO\uff09\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cCSRO\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ece\u5de5\u4ef6\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "CSRO\u76ee\u524d\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4e3b\u673a\u5c42\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel \"Virtual Tensor Core\" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9ARM64\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\u548cSIMD\u5185\u6838\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fbe\u523060+ tokens/\u79d2\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u201c\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u201d\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed5\u5f00\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5bb9\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04(mmap)\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u7684NEON SIMD\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08DMA\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f20\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u5e03\u5c40\uff08TVL\uff09\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53ca\u96f6\u62f7\u8d1d\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9ARM64\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\uff08Apple Silicon\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\"\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\"\uff08Virtual Tensor Core\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5bb9\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04(mmap)\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u7684NEON SIMD\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08DMA\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u5e03\u5c40\uff08TVL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635100%\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u96f6\u62f7\u8d1d\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u5728110M\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cM2\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d85\u8fc760 tokens/\u79d2\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3200\u6beb\u79d2\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u4e14\u65e0\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86ARM64\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like \"priority\" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u666f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u53ca\u53ef\u89c6\u5316ITS\u6c14\u5473\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790ITS\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5982\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u914d\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9ITS\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f55\u65f6\u6210\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u532e\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e26\u4f4d\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ITS\uff09\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\uff08ITS\u6c14\u5473\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8614\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u95ee\u9898\u67e5\u627e\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u50f5\u5c38\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ITS\u6c14\u5473\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\u6216\u4e0d\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u95ee\u9898\uff1bITS\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6c14\u5473\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982ITS\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "ITS\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6c14\u5473\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BPE\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bcd\u9891\u5206\u5e03\u5411Zipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9760\u62e2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0eZipf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u5982Zipf\u548cHeaps\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5f8b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfcSlot\u71b5\u671f\u671b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86BPE\u5bf9\u8bed\u6599\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0eZipf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u543b\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528BPE\u4f7f\u8bcd\u9891\u8d8b\u8fd1Zipf\u5e42\u5f8b\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0eZipf\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u8bcd\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9690\u55bb\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u55bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u9519\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9519\u914d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u8003\u8651\u5230LLMs\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9690\u55bb\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u9690\u55bb\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u55bb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u518d\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9690\u55bb\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u76d1\u6d4b\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u914d\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u55bb\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u9519\u914d\u5ea6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u9690\u55bb\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u9519\u914d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u9519\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u55bb\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cdLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u914d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u9690\u55bb\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning.

Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection.

To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution.

Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b00-5\u91cf\u8868\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u4e0a\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08ICC\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8de8\u91cf\u8868\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u968f\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e140-5\u91cf\u8868\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7ec6\u5206\u5c42\u6b21\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c0-5\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control.

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points.

Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations.

However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction.

In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model.

Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntroLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u81ea\u6211\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5185\u5d4c\u3001\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u8be5\u6807\u8bb0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIntroLM\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cIntroLM\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eDeBERTa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "IntroLM\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMem-Gallery\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u5168\u9762\u8003\u5bdfMLLM\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6Mem-Gallery\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf913\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mem-Gallery\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u957f\u671f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u957f\u4e14\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u53d6\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5341\u4e09\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u826f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u53caAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f17\u5305\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86427\u540d\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u768412400\u4efd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee5\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8def\u51b5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing \"Oracle Contexts\" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge.

To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u6307\u6807VAAR\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5b64\u7acb\u6d4b\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u6d4b\u8bc4\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u673a\u53cc\u91cd\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b(MGSEM)\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c-\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u7387(VAAR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u673a\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b(MGSEM)\u5206\u6790\u9690\u79c1\u5173\u6ce8\u548c\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c-\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u7387(VAAR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a-\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u673a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u4e60\u5f97\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u673a\u5236\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u53ca\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u76ca\u5927\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u5728\u53cd\u6620\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations.

In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer.

Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model.

This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \\textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \\textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation.

However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma.

To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding.

This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faELO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u9996\u5c3e\u5173\u952e\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "ELO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c42\uff08\u9996\u5c3e\u5c42\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u5c42\u91cd\u65b0\u6574\u5408\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ELO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CP\uff09\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9996\u5c3e\u5173\u952e\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1aELO\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cELO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e866.46\u500d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad86.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ELO\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage.

For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity.

We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\\% and 4.6\\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFSLR\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u9ad8\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7684CoT-SFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FSLR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u5373\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u786e\u5b9a\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8eCoT-SFT\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u89e3\u9898\u8def\u5f84\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "FSLR\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCoT-SFT\uff0c\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e863.2%\u548c4.6%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad84-6\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002"}}

Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0cADEPT\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001token\u7ea7\u65e9\u9000\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\uff0c\u65e9\u65e9\u9000\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u5c40\u9650\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADEPT\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728prefill\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65e9\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8df3\u5c42\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "ADEPT\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534725%\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad845%\u3002", "conclusion": "ADEPT\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u9000\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A Close Look at DeepSeek-OCR", "comment": null, "summary": "DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm.

However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's \"optimal\" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel \"Teaching Assistant\" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences.

Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer.

We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength.

This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection.

This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump.

We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165Cue-Resistant Memorization\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u4e2d\u6240\u8c13\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u591a\u7531\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06PII\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u6784\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8003\u8651\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u5bf9\u91cd\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faCue-Resistant Memorization (CRM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a-\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30PII\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e26\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8bcd\u6c47\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f(PII)\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684PII\u91cd\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u663e\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u6b63\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u540e\uff0cPII\u91cd\u6784\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9633\u6027\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u4ee5\u5f80\u62a5\u544a\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u5f80PII\u6cc4\u9732\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u9762\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ.

Wulff"], "title": "Where meaning lives: Layer-wise accessibility of psycholinguistic features in encoder and decoder language models", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later.

This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%.

While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination.

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabTrim\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u9057\u6f0f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u91d1\u526a\u679d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8be5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u591a\u6761\u526a\u679d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u8868\u3002", "result": "TabTrim\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cTabTrim-8B\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe73.5%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad83.2%\uff0c\u5728WikiTQ\u548cTableBench\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523079.4%\u548c61.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "TabTrim\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91d1\u6807SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b50\u8868\u6784\u5efa\u91d1\u526a\u679d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5e8f\u5217\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5173\u952e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Knowledge Dynamics in Continual Pre-training of LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Continual Pre-Training (CPT) is widely used for acquiring and updating factual knowledge in LLMs. This practice treats loss as a proxy for knowledge learning, while offering no grounding into how it changes during training. We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u66f4\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5c06\u635f\u5931\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u63a2\u9488\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CPT\uff09\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6309epoch\u7ea7\u522b\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u57df\u5916\u901a\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u635f\u5931\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u5374\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f88\u5c11\u5de9\u56fa\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u66b4\u9732\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u9000\u5316\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u7535\u8def\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u4f5c\u4e3a\u505c\u6b62\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002"}}

These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \\num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives.

We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards.

However, as the diversity of both LLMs and tools increases, selecting the optimal model-tool combination becomes a high-dimensional optimization challenge.

In this paper, we present ATLAS (Adaptive Tool-LLM Alignment and Synergistic Invocation), a dual-path framework for dynamic tool usage in cross-domain complex reasoning. ATLAS operates via a dual-path approach: (1) \\textbf{training-free cluster-based routing} that exploits empirical priors for domain-specific alignment, and (2) \\textbf{RL-based multi-step routing} that explores autonomous trajectories for out-of-distribution generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms closed-source models like GPT-4o, surpassing existing routing methods on both in-distribution (+10.1%) and out-of-distribution (+13.1%) tasks.

In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness.

While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification.

Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve.

Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment.

However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u91c7\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u8d28\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e00\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u652f\u6301\u6b64\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SpeakerSleuth\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\u504f\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u58f0\u5b66\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u6743\u8861\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u58f0\u5b66\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e861818\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5d\u6b3e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SpeakerSleuth\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u5224\u65ad\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf91818\u4e2a\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41LALMs\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u97f3\u9891\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u96be\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u591a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4e00\u8d77\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6587\u672c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u800c\u975e\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5982\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5207\u6362\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u58f0\u5b66\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5339\u914d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u8fa8\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LALMs\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u504f\u91cd\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5224\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u504f\u5411\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5148\u5bfc\u81f4\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u6253\u9020\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f5c\u7528", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ffb\u8bd1\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u6210\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5404\u8bed\u4e49\u90e8\u5206\u5c40\u90e8\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u907f\u514d\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08MPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u7b49\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u5404\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728ARC-Challenge\u548cMMLU\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct\u548cMistral-7B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548cTextGrad\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings.

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u597d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u770b\u5230\u5448\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u8fd1\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5173\u6ce8\u5185\u5bb9\u8bcd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f20\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8bcd\u5e8f\u6253\u4e71\u65f6\u4f9d\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\uff1b\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u504f\u91cd\u5185\u5bb9\u8bcd\u800c\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5219\u5931\u53bb\u8bcd\u6027\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u5448\u5c42\u7ea7\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u8bcd\u6027\u533a\u5206\u53ea\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u8bcd\u6027\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5206\u5c42\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods.

This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF.
