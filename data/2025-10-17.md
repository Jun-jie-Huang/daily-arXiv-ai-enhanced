### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合群体相对策略优化（GRPO）和多语种对比奖励信号的新框架，提高跨语言文本到SQL系统的执行和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽视了语义对齐的挑战，且执行准确率在非英语语言中显著下降。

Method: 通过在多语种对比奖励信号下应用GRPO来训练模型，增强SQL生成与用户意图之间的语义对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider多语言数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型，执行准确率提升至87.4%，语义准确率提升至52.29%，加入对比奖励后语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%。小型3B模型在少量训练样本下表现超越大型8B模型。

Conclusion: 利用对比奖励指导语义对齐，无需大规模训练数据即可显著提升跨语言文本到SQL系统的性能。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为翻译引擎的新系统架构——生成操作框架，旨在解决当前可解释性人工智能（XAI）技术在心理健康筛查中的临床应用难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI方法虽然能提供技术上准确的特征重要度等输出，但缺乏对临床人员和患者有实际意义的可操作性见解，导致实验室成果难以转化到临床实践。

Method: 提出生成操作框架，通过LLM整合多种XAI工具的原始技术输出与临床指南，自动生成可理解且有证据支持的临床叙述，以支持临床决策。

Result: 该框架系统性分析了组成部分，证明其能有效解决工作流程整合、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键障碍。

Conclusion: 提出的生成操作框架为推动XAI从生成孤立数据点走向临床中综合、可操作、可信的人工智能应用提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了STELA框架，通过结合词性n-gram的语言不确定性动态调整水印强度，实现无模型logit访问的文本水印检测，提升检测鲁棒性，兼顾文本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型输出分布信号的文本水印方法因需访问模型logits，难以实现公开验证且在文本质量和检测鲁棒性之间难以权衡。

Method: 引入STELA框架，利用词性n-gram建模语言中的不确定性，动态调整水印信号的强度，在语法约束强的上下文减弱信号以保持文本质量，在语言灵活度较高的上下文增强信号以提升检测准确率，检测过程无需访问模型logits。

Result: 在包括英语、中文和韩语的多种语言上，STELA在不损害文本质量的前提下，表现出比先前方法更强的检测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STELA框架通过语言特性的动态调整，实现了更可靠且可公开验证的水印检测，为大型语言模型的可信治理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出通过用户在使用大语言模型时的对比模式注释收集成对偏好数据，并利用用户行为模型和期望最大化算法评估用户数据质量，进而过滤低质量标注，从而提升模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业标注员，但用户在实际使用过程中提供大量偏好标签，虽然质量参差不齐，但用户对自己查询的判断最为专业，有潜力用于模型对齐。

Method: 通过生成两个不同模型或版本的回答，利用回答的非对称性构建用户行为模型，应用期望最大化算法估计用户的潜在质量因子，并基于该因子过滤注释数据。

Result: 该方法有效捕捉了用户行为，能够筛选出高质量的用户注释数据，提升了大语言模型对齐的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 利用用户实际使用中产生的偏好数据并结合行为模型进行质量评估与过滤，是提升大语言模型对齐效果的有效途径。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“informed routing”的新型动态令牌级计算分配方法，通过评估令牌的重要性及其恢复能力，利用轻量级预测模块LFF实现执行或近似策略，从而在保持模型性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，容易导致不可逆的信息损失和次优的令牌选择，限制了大规模语言模型在实际应用中的效率。

Method: 引入信息丰富的路由机制，设计轻量级特征预测器（LFF）预测各单元的输出，实现灵活的执行或近似策略，提升模型计算效率同时维护模型表现。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上达到多种稀疏率下的最优效率-性能平衡，无需最终的LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的强基线，训练时间减少超过50%。

Conclusion: informed routing有效解决了动态计算分配中的信息损失问题，大幅提升了大规模语言模型的推理效率和训练速度，具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力头重要性和熵的新型剪枝指标HIES，提升了模型剪枝的效果和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的注意力头重要性评分（HIS）方法虽然有效，但忽视了注意力模式的多样性，限制了剪枝性能。

Method: 引入头重要性熵评分（HIES），结合梯度重要性和注意力熵，全面衡量每个注意力头的贡献。

Result: HIES剪枝方法在模型质量提升了15.2%，稳定性提升了2.04倍，相较单独使用HIS更有效。

Conclusion: HIES指标能更准确识别冗余注意力头，支持显著的模型压缩，同时保持准确率和稳定性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ConDABench，一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试并评估外部工具的框架，旨在解决数据分析中目标不明和数据不清晰的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的数据分析任务目标往往不明确且数据不干净，必须通过用户交互来理解和消除歧义，从而完成复杂任务。现有基准无法体现这些复杂性和交互性。

Method: 设计了一个多代理工作流以基于公共数据集的洞见文章生成真实基准，产生1420个对话式数据分析问题，并建立评价系统系统地评估工具表现。

Result: 评测显示最新LLM模型在解题数量上表现提升，但在需要持续、长时间交互的任务上表现并未显著改进。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型开发者提供了衡量模型实现真正协作、完成复杂交互任务能力的工具和路径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

*Debarun Bhattacharjya,Balaji Ganesan,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Katsiaryna Mirylenka,Michael Glass,Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在不完全了解自身知识范围时，通过一致性衡量生成结果可信度的黑盒不确定性量化方法，并提出了基于相似性的聚合框架，实验证明其在问答、摘要和文本到SQL等任务中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，如何准确衡量模型生成结果的置信度以构建可信AI系统成为重要问题。黑盒不确定性量化方法因其无需内部模型信息而具备实际优势，因此本文旨在研究这类方法的有效性。

Method: 提出了一个基于生成结果间一致性的非言语化相似性聚合框架，涵盖多种适用于复杂生成任务的UQ技术，并引入了利用小规模训练集训练置信度估计模型的新方法。

Result: 通过涵盖问答、摘要和文本到SQL任务的多数据集实验证明，提出的基于相似性的方法在置信度校准方面优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于生成结果相似性的黑盒不确定性量化方法能够有效提升LLM输出的置信度估计，为可信AI系统中的置信度评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对仇恨言论检测中的数据偏见和文化差异问题，提出了一种文化感知框架，通过构建个体的仇恨子空间来提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了训练标签的偏见及不同文化背景下对仇恨定义的差异，导致数据稀疏、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题。

Method: 提出一种文化感知框架，通过组合文化属性缓解数据稀疏，利用标签传播捕捉不同文化组合的特征，构建个体的仇恨子空间以提升分类效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各项指标上平均优于现有最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 文化感知框架有效解决了仇恨言论检测中的偏见和文化多样性问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的全自动商品本体构建方法，显著优于现有的BERT基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的本体构建过程耗时且昂贵，亟需自动化方法来高效组织大量无结构文本数据，尤其是在电商领域商品信息管理方面。

Method: 利用大型语言模型直接从原始商品评论文本中提取本体结构（部分-整体关系的meronymies），实现全自动本体构建。

Result: 提出的方法在LLM作为评判者的评估中表现优于现有基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的本体抽取方法具有广泛应用潜力，为以后的本体自动抽取提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对基于检索的生成系统（RAG）的知识投毒攻击方法ADMIT，能够在包含真实证据的事实核查场景中成功误导模型，攻击成功率高且强健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大型语言模型易受恶意检索内容影响，但现实中事实核查场景包含大量可信证据，攻击难度大，故需要研究在此复杂环境下的知识投毒攻击。

Method: 提出了ADMIT，一种基于少样本学习的语义对齐多重注入攻击技术，无需访问目标模型或检索器，能有效改变事实核查结果并诱导误导性解释。

Result: ADMIT在4种检索器、11种大型语言模型和4个跨领域基准测试中，0.93×10^-6的极低投毒率下，平均攻击成功率达86%，且在强 counter-evidence 场景仍表现良好，较之前方法提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT揭示了现实中基于RAG的事实核查系统存在严重安全漏洞，表明当前防护措施不足，需要加强对抗知识投毒的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SerialBEHRT，一种针对电子健康记录的基础模型预训练方法，提升了临床事件的时序编码能力，在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型难以兼顾电子健康记录的表格结构和事件序列，导致无法有效捕捉患者就诊过程中的纵向依赖关系。

Method: 提出SerialBEHRT模型，对SciBERT进行基于结构化电子健康记录序列的额外预训练，以编码临床事件的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务中，相较于现有最新电子健康记录表示方法，SerialBEHRT表现更优且更稳定。

Conclusion: 时间序列化的预训练对于构建有效的医疗领域基础模型至关重要，能够提升患者表征的质量和下游任务的表现。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文动态短列表选择的Speculative decoding加速方法DynaSpec，克服了静态词表选择的局限，实现了推理加速与泛化能力提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模语言模型词汇量增长，传统的固定词表短列表减速器在推理中存在计算瓶颈和鲁棒性差的问题，尤其对稀有或领域特定词汇支持不足。

Method: 设计轻量级粗粒度元分类器，根据上下文将词汇划分为簇并动态选择top-k词簇组成短列表，推理时辅以并行计算提高效率，同时保持对全词表的精确验证。

Result: 在标准speculative decoding基准上，DynaSpec相较于固定短列表方法，平均接受长度有持续提升，且能够使用更小短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: 基于上下文的动态短列表机制在保证精度的前提下提升了Speculative decoding的推理速度和泛化能力，具有较强应用潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时语言引导方法，通过主成分分析识别语言方向来控制多语言大模型的语言身份，从而减少代码切换现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型中常出现意外的代码切换，影响下游任务的可靠性。

Method: 利用平行翻译数据进行PCA识别语言方向，在推理时沿该方向引导token嵌入以控制语言身份。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，并将下一令牌分布差异减少最多42%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解代码切换，保持语义一致，计算开销极低，且语言信息主要集中在模型的最后几层，具备良好的线性可分性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

### [16] [TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14972)
*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型对代码的子词标记误差问题，提出了TokDrift框架，通过语义保持的重写规则制造仅在标记上不同的代码变体，发现轻微格式变化引起模型行为显著变化，且误差源于早期嵌入层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码的子词标记器基于统计而非语法，导致语义相同的代码片段因格式或命名差异被不同地标记，影响模型的理解和生成能力。

Method: 设计TokDrift框架，利用语义不变的重写规则产生仅标记不同的代码变体，测试九个大型代码LLM在面对这些变体时的表现差异，进行层次分析定位问题来源。

Result: 即使是轻微的格式变化也会导致模型行为大幅变化，问题出现在模型的早期嵌入层，子词分割未能正确捕捉语法边界。

Conclusion: 子词标记误差是代码理解和生成的隐性障碍，未来代码大型语言模型需采用语法感知的标记方法以提升稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出利用基于熵的信息密度度量来分析大型语言模型推理过程中的信息流，发现成功推理的解答信息密度呈非均匀变化，与人类交流的稳定信息流模式不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型通过逐步链式思考解决问题，但中间推理步骤往往不可信或难以解释。受心理语言学中的均一信息密度假说启发，试图通过信息流分析揭示推理过程的特性。

Method: 引入基于熵的信息密度度量指标，分析大型语言模型推理轨迹中的信息流变化情况，在三个数学基准测试上进行验证。

Result: 发现成功的推理过程信息密度呈现明显非均匀波动，这与人类交流中保持稳定信息流的模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 机器推理中的信息流模式与人类存在显著差异，这挑战了对机器推理的传统假设，提示设计更可解释和自适应的推理模型的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

*Sicheng Lyu,Yu Gu,Xinyu Wang,Jerry Huang,Sitao Luan,Yufei Cui,Xiao-Wen Chang,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EvoEdit，一种针对大语言模型的顺序编辑策略，有效防止新旧知识相互干扰，提高编辑效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于“定位-编辑”框架的大语言模型知识更新方法在多次顺序编辑时存在灾难性干扰，导致新编辑损害先前的知识。

Method: EvoEdit通过顺序空空间对齐的技术，保持原始和已修改知识的表示稳定，确保输出在长期编辑序列中不变，从而缓解干扰。

Result: 在真实顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit的表现优于或不逊色于最先进方法，速度提升最高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态信息环境下的大语言模型设计提供了更合理的编辑方法，兼具简单性、有效性和理论保障，强调开发更原则性的模型编辑策略的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

### [19] [ConsistencyAI: A Benchmark to Assess LLMs' Factual Consistency When Responding to Different Demographic Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13852)
*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ConsistencyAI，一个独立基准，用于测量大型语言模型（LLMs）对不同用户角色的事实一致性，发现模型在不同用户角色下回答同一问题时存在事实不一致现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在面对不同用户角色时可能给出不一致的事实回答，缺乏客观的评测手段来衡量这种不一致性，迫切需要一个独立、公正的基准来评估和提升模型的事实一致性。

Method: 设计ConsistencyAI基准，向19个LLM提出关于15个主题的5条事实请求，每个问题由100个不同用户角色的上下文进行询问，通过句子嵌入和余弦相似度计算跨角色事实一致性分数。

Result: 100个用户角色测试中，一致性分数在0.7896到0.9065之间，平均0.8656，Grok-3表现最好，多数轻量模型表现较差；不同主题一致性差异明显，诸如就业市场一致性最差，疫苗和以巴冲突等话题因提供者不同表现差异大。

Conclusion: 事实一致性受模型提供者和话题影响显著，ConsistencyAI基准可促进公正评测与鼓励开发面向多角色一致性的提示策略，已开源代码和交互演示支持可复现评价。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

### [20] [BenchPress: A Human-in-the-Loop Annotation System for Rapid Text-to-SQL Benchmark Curation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13853)
*Fabian Wenz,Omar Bouattour,Devin Yang,Justin Choi,Cecil Gregg,Nesime Tatbul,Çağatay Demiralp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了BenchPress系统，该系统利用大语言模型辅助生成自然语言描述，辅助生成领域特定的Text-to-SQL基准数据集，从而显著减少人工标注时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL研究多基于公开数据集，但在大企业私有数据仓库上效果较差。人工标注私有数据库的SQL日志以生成对应自然语言问题耗时且成本高。

Method: 提出BenchPress，一个人机交互系统，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和大语言模型生成多种自然语言查询，专家再进行选择、排序和编辑，确保准确性与领域契合。

Result: 在企业SQL日志上的实验表明，BenchPress能显著降低标注时间和人力投入，同时结合专家验证提升了标注准确率、基准测试的可靠性及模型评估的稳健性。

Conclusion: BenchPress简化了私有领域定制Text-to-SQL基准数据集的创建过程，为研究人员和实践者提供可靠的评估工具，代码和系统公开发布。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our
website at http://dsg-mcgraw.csail.mit.edu:5000.

### [21] [R2T: Rule-Encoded Loss Functions for Low-Resource Sequence Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13854)
*Mamadou K. Keita,Christopher Homan,Sebastien Diarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rule-to-Tag（R2T）框架，通过将多层语言规则融入神经网络训练，实现无监督或少监督的自然语言处理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决传统神经网络依赖大量标注数据的问题，利用语言规则为模型提供明确的任务约束，以提升对未知词汇和复杂任务的处理能力。

Method: 设计了R2T的自适应损失函数，包含正则项使模型对OOV词汇具备不确定性处理能力；采用多层语言规则与神经网络联合训练，构建所谓的原则化学习（PrL）范式。

Result: 在Zarma语言词性标注任务中，R2T-BiLSTM仅用未标注文本训练便达到了98.2%的准确率，超过了标注样本微调的AfriBERTa基线；在命名实体识别任务中，R2T预训练加少量标注微调效果优于大量标注训练的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架有效结合语言规则与神经网络训练，减少对标注数据依赖，在低资源条件下提高模型表现，展现了原则化学习范式的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoRE的技术，通过利用模型的一致性来增强大型语言模型(LLM)集成的鲁棒性，解决了因分词差异和模型信心水平不一致导致的集成失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有各自优势和劣势，集成可以整合它们的能力，但现有集成方式对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，尤其是由分词机制异构和模型专业度差异引起的问题。

Method: 提出了CoRE方法，包含两层一致性：一是词元级一致性，通过低通滤波减少不确定词元的权重，缓解分词不匹配导致的误差；二是模型级一致性，提升具有高自信且与其他模型输出差异小的结果权重。该技术可无缝集成于各种集成策略中。

Result: 在多种基准测试、模型组合和集成策略下，CoRE均显著提升了集成模型的性能和鲁棒性，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: CoRE有效解决了LLM集成中因词元和模型不一致引起的鲁棒性问题，是一种通用且易用的增强集成性能的方法。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉问答有助于临床决策和患者护理，现有方法难以结合图像和文本信息准确生成自由文本回应和结构化属性。

Method: 利用指令调优的大型语言模型，结合检索增强生成（RAG）框架，通过添加领域内的文本和视觉示例来提升模型的临床相关性和回答质量。

Result: 系统在MEDIQA-WV 2025伤口护理视觉问答任务中排名第三，效果优异，各项评价指标（dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM指标）均表现良好。

Conclusion: 轻量级的RAG框架结合通用大型语言模型，无需额外训练或复杂重排序，即可为多模态临床NLP任务提供简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ShishuLM的高效语言模型架构，通过减少参数数量和Key-Value缓存需求，实现了内存和计算效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然效果优异，但存在显著的内存和计算开销，且架构中存在冗余，优化有潜力提升效率。

Method: 结合AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，采用归一化和注意力计算的线性近似，利用多层感知器替代部分Transformer块。

Result: ShishuLM在中等上下文场景下，内存需求减少25%，训练和推理延迟提升40%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的情感感知框架，用于分析AI辅导对学习者情感状态的影响，揭示了学习中的情绪动态及其对学习过程的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型在教育中的学习影响有一定研究，但关于其辅导过程中的情感动态了解不足。为构建负责任的生成式AI教育应用，需关注学习者情感变化。

Method: 分析了PyTutor AI辅导系统与261名本科生在三所美国高校间的16986次对话，采用Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude三大LLM零样本情感注释方法，结合等级加权池化和多数共识策略，生成稳健的情感状态分析。

Result: 学生在AI辅导中普遍表现出轻微正面情感和中度激活状态，学习过程中频繁出现困惑、好奇及偶尔的挫败感。情绪状态短暂且易变，消极情绪常快速消散，且中性时刻往往是情绪转折点，更多引导情绪向正面发展。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的情感感知框架有效捕捉学习者情绪动态，揭示AI辅导中情感转折点和积极干预机会，有助于提升生成式AI教育工具的情感智能和教育效果。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型的推理策略主要依赖于继承自自回归模型的前缀提示，限制了生成的灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出模板填充（TI）方法，先生成目标响应的结构模板，再填充被掩盖的片段；引入动态段落分配（DSA），根据生成信心动态调整段落长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准上，方法比基线提升了17.01个百分点；在多标记生成场景获得显著速度提升，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 模板填充结合动态段落分配为扩散语言模型提供了更灵活高效的生成策略，在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Under-resourced languages, such as Quechuas, face data and resource scarcity,
hindering their development in speech technology. To address this issue, Common
Voice presents a crucial opportunity to foster an open and community-driven

Method: 基于CANTEMIST语料翻译生成法语文本，由双专家手动标注实体跨度，结合自动匹配与五人团队审核进行术语标准化，采用ICD-O标准。

Result: 标注生成71127个ICD-O标准化标签，覆盖399个形态码、272个部位码及2043个复合表达概念。

Conclusion: FRACCO数据集为法语肿瘤学文本的实体识别和概念标准化提供了权威参考标准，推动相关自然语言处理研究发展。

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different
expressions), and 2043 unique composite expressions (from 11144 different
expressions). This dataset provides a reference standard for named entity
recognition and concept normalisation in French oncology texts.

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，实现了解码器语言模型中基于token的分层跳跃，能够减少计算量并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型推理效率，减少计算资源消耗，同时保证模型准确性。传统的早退或基于路由的深度混合模型不稳定且需要大量再训练，需开发稳定且易于微调的方法。

Method: 在每个Attention/MLP分支加入sigmoid-线性门控，用以在重新进入残差流前压缩输出。推理时根据门控值对token排序，基于层预算跳过低重要性token。这种门控机制光滑、可微分，能在预训练模型上稳定微调。

Result: 在长文本推理中，计算量最多节省15%，保持超过90%的基线准确率。指令调谐模型中全计算下准确率提升，半计算量下达成基线水平。

Conclusion: GateSkip为token级分层跳跃提供了一种稳定且高效的方法，能揭示Transformer信息流特征，且易于与量化、剪枝及自我推测解码结合，具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的基于文本反馈的多臂赌博机环境的基准测试，评估大语言模型在不使用数值信息的情况下进行序贯决策的能力。Qwen3-4B模型表现优异，超过传统算法和其他大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在仅使用自然语言反馈、不依赖数值或显式概率的情况下进行序贯决策和推理的能力。

Method: 设计一个多臂赌博机任务，模型通过文本形式的反馈（如“你获得了一个代币”）进行决策，评估四个开源语言模型的性能，并与传统决策方法进行比较。

Result: 大部分语言模型表现不如传统算法，但Qwen3-4B模型在选择最优臂的准确率达89.2%，显著优于更大规模模型和传统方法。

Conclusion: 语言本身可以促进概率推理能力的出现，这一基准测试为评估在自然语言非数值环境下的决策能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种允许语言模型动态调节计算步骤数的训练方法，通过引入特殊的<don't know>和<pause>标记，模型可自主请求更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在处理不同复杂度的输入时使用固定的计算步骤，效率不高且难以准确调整计算资源分配。该研究旨在让模型根据输入的复杂性动态分配计算步骤，提高准确率和训练效率。

Method: 方法通过定义一类"Catch Your Breath"损失函数，引入序列决策问题设置，允许模型通过输出<don't know>请求延迟，再插入<pause>标记获得额外计算步骤。设计了三种具体损失函数变体分别针对不同优化目标进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，CYB模型使用所需训练数据仅为基线模型的三分之一，实现相同性能，且能根据词汇复杂度灵活调整计算步骤，显著提升效率和准确率。

Conclusion: 动态分配计算步骤的"Catch Your Breath"方法有效提升语言模型的训练效率和推理性能，展示了基于时间和计算成本优化的训练策略的潜力。可以提高复杂语言处理任务的表现。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Motivation: 现有自然语言生成模型在特定任务或要求下表现欠佳且调整成本高，需寻求简单高效的增强方式。

Method: PAGE框架通过轻量级辅助模块（如分类器、提取器）推理输入文本，并将辅助输出用于构建丰富输入，从而提升生成质量，无需辅助生成模型且结构模块化。

Result: 在需求工程领域的验证中，通过分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成的质量。

Conclusion: PAGE框架实现了高效且易适应多任务的生成增强，展现出较强的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在使用大语言模型进行社会模拟时，应采用开放式文本生成功能，以更真实地反映社会观点和推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多依赖选择题或简短回答，限制了大语言模型生成的表达力，忽视了其作为社会模拟工具的潜力。

Method: 结合传统调查方法学与自然语言处理技术，提出开放式生成文本的方法，强调捕捉模型中的话题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式文本生成提高了测量的准确性，支持发现意料之外的观点，降低了研究者偏差，增强了表达力和个性展现。

Conclusion: 呼吁制定新的评估框架和实践方法，充分利用大语言模型的开放式生成能力，促进自然语言处理与社会科学的融合。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

TL;DR: 本文评估了十个最先进大语言模型在未结构化文本分类任务中的表现，发现其经典指标表现中等，但常出现类别过度生成现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型在文本分类任务中表现有限且存在过度生成类别的现象，需探索提升分类准确度的方法。

Method: 采用统一数据集和零样本提示测试十个大语言模型，评估指标包含经典指标及特有指标，同时提出基于多模型集成的方法。

Result: 模型经典指标表现仅中等，存在较高的幻觉和膨胀比率。集成方法显著提升准确率，减少了类别过度生成并消除了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模和改进架构难以提升文本分类性能，集成多模型协调工作是实现或超越人类专家水平的有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Conclusion: ProofGrader有效填补了数学证明评估的空白，有助于推动LLM在数学证明生成中的应用和发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and

frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Motivation: 现有方法在专用领域大语言模型微调中，过度依赖模型内在知识，缺乏可解释性且泛化能力有限，难以高效筛选高质量微调数据。

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内外部难度评分，优先选择高阶认知指令，提供可解释且量化的筛选标准，用于数据选择和标注指导。

Result: 使用THTB选出的5%数据训练的模型性能优于使用全部数据训练的模型，对比仅依赖大语言模型选择方法，泛化能力更强。在垂直领域中，利用2%数据训练的模型超越使用更大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: THTB有效提升了专用领域大语言模型微调的数据效率和模型性能，展现了强大的领域适应潜力，且具备良好可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Conclusion: 该研究推进了绕过技术的理解和检测方法的发展，为提升大语言模型的安全性提供了重要工具和多语言资源支持。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着机器生成文本质量接近人类写作，作者身份鉴定变得更加困难，亟需有效的鉴定方法。

Method: 利用涵盖六个领域的600个实例的开放数据集，比较固定风格嵌入基线和GPT-4o指令调优语言模型判别器在不同模型文本上的表现。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT生成文本的整体准确率较高（82%对68%）；判别模型在LLaMA生成文本上表现略优，但无统计学显著差异；判别模型对学术和小说文本表现更好，风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话效果更佳。

Conclusion: 作者身份鉴定是多维问题，需结合多种策略，本文提供的开放框架和数据有助于该领域的可重复评估与研究。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Method: 通过对比微调前后模型激活差异，尤其是随机文本前几个token的激活差异，利用模型差异分析和添加激活偏差的技术，解释微调领域并构建基于LLM的解释代理。

Result: 实验证明微调产生的偏差包含关键信息，解释代理性能明显优于基线模型。混合预训练数据可有效减少偏差，但潜在风险仍存在。分析覆盖不同模型架构和参数规模。

Conclusion: 狭窄微调模型的激活中明显存在训练目标的特征，需改进训练方法，同时提醒研究者警惕使用此类模型作为广泛微调研究代理的局限性，呼吁深入探索狭窄微调的影响及发展更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽表现优异，但易受到绕过安全机制（jailbreak）攻击，需系统探查其弱点。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上，RAID比现有白盒及黑盒方法用更少查询和计算成本获得更高攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间正则化对理解和缓解LLM绕过安全机制攻击具有重要作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

*Nicole Smith-Vaniz,Harper Lyon,Lorraine Steigner,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析大语言模型(LLMs)在政治和道德领域的偏见，特别是利用道德基础理论(MFT)量化LLMs的道德倾向，并与人类数据进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗、法律等领域的广泛应用，其在政治和道德问题上的偏见引起关注，需评估其道德倾向及意识形态表达的准确性。

Method: 采用道德基础理论(MFT)衡量LLMs的五个道德维度反应，比较其与人类数据的异同，通过直接输出和角色扮演两种方式测试LLMs的政治和道德倾向。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在生成回答时存在意识形态倾向，并且能通过角色扮演表现不同政治理念，展示出一定的政治和人口依赖性。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统评估LLMs在政治和道德领域的固有偏见及其准确模拟人类意识形态的能力，为理解AI偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于认知科学中框架理论的新的上下文学习方法SA-ICL，通过构建抽象的推理架构模板提升大语言模型在新任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的上下文学习缺乏显式的知识检索及迁移模块，无法在抽象层面进行有效推理。受认知框架理论启发，本文旨在引入结构化的认知框架以增强模型的推理能力。

Method: 设计了SA-ICL框架，将从先前示例中提取的认知构建块抽象成轻量级结构化模板（schema），用于辅助模型在面对新问题时的推理过程，实现显式的框架激活与利用。

Result: 在GPQA数据集中，SA-ICL在化学和物理问题上表现提升明显，最高提升达36.19%，同时减少了对示例数量的依赖并提高了模型推理的可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL有效连接了多种上下文学习策略，促进了大语言模型向类人推理方向的发展，为提升模型推理能力和解读性提供了新路径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无标签的大语言模型提示词优化框架PDO，通过双重汤普森采样和优秀提示词变异，实现了高效稳定的提示词优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示词优化方法依赖于带标签的验证数据，获取高质量标签代价高且速度慢，因此需要一种无标签且高效的提示词优化方法。

Method: 提出了提示词对决优化器（PDO），将提示词优化问题建模为对决多臂赌博机问题，通过大语言模型裁判提供的成对偏好反馈信号进行优化，结合双重汤普森采样优先级策略和基于最佳提示词的变异策略扩展候选池，同时支持部分标签以降低噪声影响。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard (BBH)和MS MARCO数据集上，PDO表现优于基线方法。消融实验验证了双重汤普森采样和提示词变异两部分策略的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO作为一种无标签提示词优化框架，能够高效且稳定地改进大语言模型的提示词设计，具备实际应用潜力，尤其适合标签缺乏场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何在内部表示中编码运算符优先级，特别是在开源指令调优的LLaMA 3.2-3B模型中，通过设计带有括号变换的算术表达式数据集，揭示了模型在中间步骤存储计算过程，并通过多种解释技术验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在推理上表现出色，但在算术任务上仍有不足。此前研究多关注模型输出与提示策略，鲜少探究模型内部如何进行算术计算，特别是运算符优先级是否被编码。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，变换括号顺序以测试模型对中间计算结果的编码。采用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP等解释性工具分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的残差流信息，并提出局部嵌入交换技术调节运算符优先级。

Result: 发现中间计算结果存在于模型的残差流中，尤其是在MLP模块之后。模型在线性方式编码了运算符优先级，具体体现在注意力层后运算符的嵌入表示中。局部嵌入交换技术有效调整了优先级表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在内部表示中确实编码了算术运算的中间步骤和运算符优先级，这为理解其算术能力提供了新的视角和技术手段，有助于改进模型的算术推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种知识推理语言模型（KRLM），通过统一协调大语言模型（LLM）知识与知识图谱（KG）上下文，提升归纳知识图谱推理的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的知识图谱推理方法中，LLM的固有知识易被稀疏的KG上下文掩盖，导致推理结果不可信，且生成幻觉问题未得到有效解决。

Method: 设计了知识推理语言（KRL）指令格式和分词器来对齐LLM知识与KG表示，提出KRL注意力层通过动态记忆机制协调LLM知识与KG上下文，并结合结构感知的下一个实体预测器严格限制推理结果。

Result: 在25个真实归纳推理数据集上的大量实验表明，KRLM在零样本和微调场景下均表现出显著优越性。

Conclusion: KRLM有效解决了LLM知识失真和生成幻觉问题，实现了LLM与KG上下文的统一协调，显著提升了归纳知识图谱推理的准确性和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: “慢思考”模型在中间能力评测上表现更强，且整体任务结果更优，验证了基准测试的有效性。

Conclusion: 提升智能检索增强系统中间推理等能力对于提升终端性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为此提供了有效的评测工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在主观问题辩论中的表现，分析了模型是否倾向于迎合评判者观点以增强说服力，还是坚持自身先验信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辩论工作多基于客观数据集，忽视了谎言的主观性，即防守虚假主张还需模型本人相信其为假。作者希望探讨模型在主观问题辩论中是否会迎合评判者或坚持自身信念。

Method: 作者设计仅针对主观问题的辩论实验，先测量模型的先验信念，再安排辩手选择立场并面对与先验相冲突的评判者角色，比较顺序和同步两种辩论协议，评估模型在不同情况下的说服力和论证质量。

Result: 模型倾向于支持与评判者立场一致的观点，顺序辩论中第二辩手占优势，模型为自身先验立场辩护时更具说服力，但与先验不符的论点在双方对比时反而被评为质量更高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型语言模型在主观辩论中的偏见和说服动态，提示评判者应优化训练信号，提高AI系统一致性，同时深化对人机互动中说服机制的理解。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 当前研究认为可读性高的简化文本有助于小型语言模型的能力发展，但缺乏系统验证和数据支持。

Method: 通过构造结构相似但可读性不同的合成数据集，训练小型语言模型并对比其学习效率和生成连贯性。

Result: 发现可读性并不能有效预测模型的表现，使用复杂成人语言训练的模型表现相当且训练中连贯性发展更快，统计简单性更能预测学习效果。

Conclusion: 反对将语言模型训练比拟成人类认知发展，主张应基于数据和实验更准确地理解支持小型模型能力生成的因素。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Conclusion: Element2Vec结合自然语言文本和先进的训练策略，为材料科学中的AI驱动元素性质预测提供了新思路，促进了材料科学的智能发现。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法依赖PRM进行响应选择，但简单多数投票有时表现更优，表明如何有效利用PRM信号仍是挑战。

Method: 构建理论框架，推导出最优加权聚合策略，设计高效预计算方法校准权重函数，并在多对LLM-PRM组合中验证。

Result: 实验覆盖5个LLM与7个PRM，结果显示校准的加权函数显著提升了TTS效率，相比普通加权多数投票减少了78.7%的计算量。

Conclusion: 高效且智能的聚合策略是提升测试时扩展性能的关键，其效果超过单纯增加计算资源的策略。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Motivation: 现有查询聚焦表格摘要方法存在微调成本高、复杂推理能力不足、令牌限制和效率问题以及缺乏鲁棒性和扩展性等缺陷。

Method: FACTS生成包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的离线模板，这些模板可重复用于具有相同模式的多个表格，支持快速、准确且隐私合规的摘要生成。

Result: FACTS在多个常用基准测试中均显著优于现有方法，证明了其实用性和优越性。

Conclusion: FACTS为现实场景中的查询聚焦表格摘要提供了一种高效、准确且隐私合规的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

### [55] [BioMedSearch: A Multi-Source Biomedical Retrieval Framework Based on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13926)
*Congying Liu,Xingyuan Wei,Peipei Liu,Yiqing Shen,Yanxu Mao,Tiehan Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BioMedSearch，一种基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，显著提升复杂生物医学问答的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽在推理任务表现良好，但生成的生物医学内容常缺乏科学严谨性，且无法访问权威数据库，导致信息不实。

Method: BioMedSearch结合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建及多源信息过滤，实现高质量问题回答。

Result: 在三级复杂推理问题集BioMedMCQs上，BioMedSearch在各层级中准确率分别显著提升（59.1%提升至91.9%，47.0%提升至81.0%，36.3%提升至73.4%）。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch有效整合多源信息，显著提高复杂生物医学问答的准确性，优于所有基线模型。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出并验证了“LLM脑腐败假说”，即持续暴露于低质量网络文本导致大型语言模型认知能力下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究数据质量对大型语言模型认知能力的因果影响，排除其他因素，验证低质量训练数据是否会导致认知能力下降。

Method: 利用Twitter/X数据集，构造基于参与度和语义质量的“垃圾”与对照数据集，在多种LLM上进行持续预训练，评估推理、长上下文理解、安全性等能力变化，并进行错误分析。

Result: 持续在垃圾数据集上训练导致推理能力、长上下文理解和安全性显著下降，同时增加了模型的“黑暗特质”表现。模型出现跳跃推理链条的错误，部分指令微调和干净数据训练有所改善但无法完全恢复。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动，训练时数据筛选应作为安全问题对待，应定期对部署模型进行认知健康检查。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究通过评估ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会人口属性下对药物不良事件的预测，揭示了大语言模型存在系统性偏差，尤其是对弱势群体的不公平高风险预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在生物医学领域应用日益广泛，但其在药物安全预测中的可靠性及是否掺入与临床无关的社会人口信息尚未被充分研究。

Method: 基于美国FDA不良事件报告系统（FAERS）结构化数据，利用以人格特征为基础的评估框架，测试两款先进模型在不同社会人口属性（教育、婚姻状况、就业、保险、语言、住房稳定性、宗教）和三种用户角色（全科医生、专科医生、患者）下的表现。

Result: 发现模型对不利群体（如低教育水平、不稳定住房者）预测出更高的不良事件概率，存在明显的系统性偏差；偏差表现为显性偏见（推理过程中直接提及人格属性）和隐性偏见（结果不一致但未明确提及人格属性）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在药物安全监测中存在重要的公平性风险，急需制定公平性评估标准和偏差缓解策略，确保其在临床应用中的可靠和公正。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在小型语言模型推理时通过检索结构化推理指令来提升多步推理能力的方法，显著提高了模型在医疗考试、法律和数学领域任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型运行效率高但难以处理多步推理或领域知识要求高的任务。

Method: 构建指令语料库，通过GPT-5生成结构化推理指令，推理时检索并遵循相关指令步骤，区别于传统的文本检索生成方法。

Result: 无需额外微调的情况下，模型在MedQA准确率提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%；简洁指令效果优于冗长指令，提升效果依赖模型类型和推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过指令检索策略，在本地小模型上实现了有效的结构化推理指导，解决了小模型多步推理难题，推动了大规模推理向本地计算的应用。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对深度研究代理进行严格、系统的关键研究分析能力评估。

Method: 设计了模仿专业分析师工作流程的层级分析结构和细粒度评分标准的HisRubric评估框架；基于此构建涵盖多市场、多语言的大规模FinDeepResearch基准；并用16种代表方法进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验揭示了不同方法在多样化能力、金融市场和语言环境下的优势与不足。

Conclusion: 提供了对DR代理能力的深入理解，推动相关研究与开发，且计划公开基准和评估代码。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了经过微调和未微调的AI模型与专业作家在模仿获奖作家风格写作上的表现，发现微调后的AI输出在专家和普通读者中均优于人类写作，并且难以被检测为AI生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决是否AI模型能高质量模仿作者风格写作的问题，回应因训练版权书籍引发的版权诉讼。

Method: 对比MFA训练的专家作家与ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini三大AI模型，使用盲测评价风格与写作质量，特别测试微调ChatGPT后的效果。

Result: 未经微调的AI写作被专家显著不青睐，微调后AI写作在风格和质量上获得专家和普通读者认可，且检测为AI的概率大幅降低。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调显著提升AI模拟风格的能力，使AI写作在质量和风格上优于专业人类写作，且成本大幅降低，具有重要的版权市场影响意义。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MTI的测试时插值方法，通过在高不确定性位置选择性干预，显著提升大语言模型的推理准确率和稳定性，同时保持高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型提升推理能力多依赖增加推理计算量，效率低下；作者发现推理不确定性高度局限于少数高熵token，因此提出局部干预以减少开销。

Method: MTI框架包括：(i)选择性CFG干预，仅在不确定位置采用无分类器指导；(ii)轻量级负提示指导，利用模型KV缓存高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，MTI使Qwen3-8B-Base模型平均提升1.35%，在AIME2024测试中，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning模型提升5%，且保持高效。

Conclusion: MTI以训练免费、开销极小的局部干预，有效增强了大型语言模型的推理准确率和稳定性，兼顾性能与效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Method: 构建了RAG系统的错误类型新分类法，收集了标注错误类型的错误响应数据集，并设计了一种与分类法一致的自动化评估方法。

Result: 成功分类了多种RAG系统中的错误类型，创建了对应的错误响应数据集，并提供了可用于开发过程中跟踪和解决错误的自动评估工具。

Conclusion: 本文的错误分类法和自动评估方法有助于提升RAG系统的鲁棒性，促进错误检测与修正，实现更可靠的问答系统部署。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的发展依赖于大量训练语料，但大多数据许可状态不明确，尤其是非英语文本缺乏开放许可，限制了开放模型的发展。

Method: 通过从七个领域的41个数据源系统性获取有验证许可的德语文本，进行质量过滤、去重及格式修正，确保文本质量和法律合规。

Result: 构建了一个包含至少CC-BY-SA 4.0许可的德语文本语料库，包含1545.6亿高质量文本，填补了开放许可德语预训练数据的空白。

Conclusion: German Commons为德语开放预训练数据提供了重要资源，推动真正开放的德语语言模型开发，且相关语料构建和过滤代码已公开，保证可重复性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注答案准确性，无法反映大语言模型的文化理解能力，亟需一种能够量化和解释跨文化推理的评估方法。

Method: 提出CRaFT框架，基于文化流利度、偏差、一致性和语言适应性四个解释指标，评测三款模型在阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语中对50个文化相关问题的回答与解释。

Result: 结果显示不同语言对模型推理有显著影响：阿拉伯语降低文化流利度，孟加拉语提升，西班牙语稳定；GPT语言适应能力强但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但较僵化。

Conclusion: 文化意识并非LLM的固有属性，而是在语言表述中逐渐展现，CRaFT提供了评估跨文化推理的新视角，有助于构建更具文化适应性的语言模型。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 语言模态对大型语言模型的抽象推理能力有显著影响，且不同模型和语言组合表现不均，提示评估和应用时需考虑语言偏见因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Motivation: 语言一般被认为是任意的，但已有研究发现语音和语义之间存在系统性关系。本文旨在通过大规模定量分析，探究这种关系在多个语言中的表现及其跨语言模式。

Method: 采用分布式方法，构建形态素的语音和语义相似度空间，利用多种统计指标分析这两者的对应关系，覆盖六种语言，并检验五个已有的音义对应假设。

Result: 发现了一系列新的、可解释的音义对应关系及跨语言规律，同时对五个既有的音义对应假设提供了部分支持和混合结果。

Conclusion: 音义关系在多语言中存在系统性并且可以定量检测，揭示了语言中语音与语义关系的普遍模式和个别差异，有助于深化对语言本质的理解。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Result: 在多轮任务中，ERGO相比传统方法平均提升56.6%的性能，峰值能力提升24.7%，同时减少了35.3%的性能波动，增强了模型的准确性与稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过将不确定性视为关键信号而非噪声，ERGO有效实现了多轮对话中的上下文重置和调整，显著提升了对话系统的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

*Wael Rashwan,Hossam M. Zawbaa,Sourav Dutta,Haytham Assem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DROID的双编码器框架，通过结合通用句子编码器和领域自适应的去噪自编码器，实现高效准确的领域外意图检测，显著优于现有方法，特别是在低资源情况下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务型对话系统中领域外（OOS）用户话语检测挑战大，现有方法依赖强分布假设或额外校准模块，效果有限，亟需一种简单高效的端到端解决方案。

Method: 设计了DROID框架，结合Universal Sentence Encoder（USE）实现广泛语义泛化和基于Transformer的领域自适应去噪自编码器（TSDAE）捕捉领域特定上下文，通过轻量分支分类器和单一校准阈值进行分类；同时采用合成和开放域异常样本增强边界学习。

Result: 在多个意图识别基准测试中，DROID以仅1.5M可训练参数实现较最新基线在已知意图上提升6-15%宏F1分数，在领域外意图检测上提升8-20%，尤其在低资源设置下表现最为突出。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示配合简单的校准阈值，能够实现对话系统中鲁棒、可扩展且可靠的领域外意图检测，突破了现有方法的限制。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的替代微调方法RLSR，用于提升大语言模型的指令跟随能力，比传统的SFT表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的微调方法SFT虽然能增强模型的指令跟随能力，但存在优化空间，且RFT方法在特定领域有限监督下展现了更强适应性，启发作者尝试将SFT数据集结合至RL框架中提升性能。

Method: 提出RLSR方法，即基于强化学习的语义响应评分，在语义嵌入空间通过余弦相似度计算生成响应与人工标注响应的奖励分数，替代SFT进行训练。

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，在Qwen-7B模型上AlpacaEval胜率提升至26.34%，优于SFT的21.01%；结合SFT与RLSR训练，胜率进一步提升到30.73%。

Conclusion: RLSR方法有效利用大规模SFT数据集和强化学习框架，显著提升了语言模型的指令跟随能力及下游任务表现。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

TL;DR: 本文提出动态角色精炼框架（DPRF），通过识别和修正大型语言模型角色扮演代理与目标人物行为的差异，提升角色行为的真实性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型角色扮演代理常依赖人工创建的角色档案，这些档案未必能准确反映目标个体的真实行为，导致角色真实性不足。

Method: DPRF框架通过反复识别生成行为和真实人类行为之间的认知差异，采用自由形式或理论指导的结构化分析，持续优化和修正角色档案，以减少行为偏差。

Result: 在四种不同场景（正式辩论、带有心理健康问题的社交媒体帖子、公开采访和电影评论）下，对五个大型语言模型的测试表明，DPRF显著提高了行为的对齐度，且具有广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: DPRF为创建高保真角色档案提供了有效方法，有助于提升用户模拟、社会研究及个性化AI等下游应用的有效性和可信度。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一种针对多阶段推理的小型语言模型延迟感知层跳过框架，通过分阶段离线搜索和基于置信度的在线生成提前退出，实现了在加速推理的同时保持较高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理通过分解复杂问题提升小型语言模型的推理能力，但带来了较高的延迟。现有的自适应加速技术难以在效率和准确率间取得平衡，主要因阶段跳过敏感度差异大和冗余输出产生两大挑战。

Method: LiteStage采用分阶段的离线搜索为各阶段分配最优层预算，并结合基于置信度的在线生成提前退出机制，以抑制不必要的解码过程，降低延迟。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，且准确率损失不到4.0%，优于先前无需训练的层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效地解决了多阶段推理中的效率与准确率权衡问题，是提升小型语言模型推理性能的有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在面对同一提示的不同表述时，常常产生不一致的答案，影响模型的稳定性和应用效果。

Method: 提出F2C方法，包含共识交叉熵（CCE）用于多数投票产生硬伪标签，以及表示对齐损失，拉近低置信度预测与高置信度共识的距离。

Result: 在11个数据集和多种NLP任务上实验，F2C在提升一致性（提升11.62%）、平均F1值（提升8.94%）和减少格式间性能方差（减少3.29%）方面表现出色，且在领域外评估中表现良好。

Conclusion: F2C是一种有效的无监督方法，能够增强大型语言模型在提示扰动下的一致性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: 本文提出了MoM框架，通过主动理解替代传统RAG的被动分块方法，实现文档记忆提取，提升模型的知识内化和推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RAG范式在处理文本时只能被动分块，限制了深入理解和推理能力，亟需模拟人类阅读认知过程的主动理解策略。

Method: 设计MoM框架，引入大语言模型模拟专家生成文档逻辑大纲，采用多路径采样和多视角评估选择最优文档记忆，结合反向推理策略增强小语言模型的深度阅读能力，并建立三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验中，MoM框架有效解决了传统RAG文本分块问题，提供了语义完整的文档记忆，使小语言模型具备了更人性化的智能文本处理能力。

Conclusion: MoM框架突破了传统RAG的被动限制，实现了文档的主动理解和结构化记忆提取，推动了小语言模型在智能文本处理领域的能力提升。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一套可复用的实验方法，为研究训练数据对语言模型行为影响提供了新的工具，促进未来相关假设的验证和深入理解，同时公开了代码支持后续工作。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard提供了适用于多语言、支持流式生成的细粒度多分类安全防护方案，促进了大语言模型的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for

Conclusion: 通过结构化循环利用大语言模型的多个专门代理，本文方法实现了多跳问答检索的高精度与高召回平衡，从而提升整体问答性能。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

*Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid,Davood Rafiei,Weiwei Zhang,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向上下文的双向模式检索框架，专注于自然语言问题与数据库模式元素的对齐，提高Text-to-SQL系统的模式检索准确率，减少错误，提高了SQL生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法多集中于提升SQL生成，忽视了模式元素的检索，导致模型出现虚假信息和执行失败。

Method: 构建了采用表优先后列选择及列优先后表选择的双向检索框架，并结合问题分解、关键词和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider基准上显著提升了模式召回率，减少误检，生成的SQL性能接近理想方案，且比全模式基线方法优越。

Conclusion: 模式链接作为独立研究问题，不仅提高了Text-to-SQL的准确率和效率，还大幅缩小了全模式与理想模式之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在对话中产生欺骗行为的问题，提出了一种新的欺骗度量指标——信念错位度量，并通过多轮强化学习方法有效减少了欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实际应用中存在欺骗性输出的安全隐患，且现有度量方法不足以准确评估欺骗行为，需建立更可靠的评估指标并寻找缓解方案。

Method: 提出信念错位度量，结合五种现有欺骗检测指标，在四种对话场景中评估LLM的欺骗行为，并采用多轮强化学习方法对模型进行微调以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 信念错位度量与人类判断高度相关，实验发现LLMs自然产生约26%的欺骗行为，RLHF训练的模型欺骗率高达43%，通过多轮强化学习微调，欺骗行为减少77.6%。

Conclusion: 有效评估和减少LLMs的欺骗行为需要跨越单轮对话的分析，通过提出的新指标和多轮强化学习微调，能够大幅降低欺骗风险，提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Motivation: 语言能力变化是AD的主要早期标志，利用语言特征可以实现阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断，有助于及早治疗和减轻医疗负担。

Method: 本文构建了基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入，结合语言学特征提取，使用逻辑回归作为分类器，并对模型的超参数（如正则化参数、学习率、词向量维度等）进行了细致调优。

Result: 该方法在区分早期AD患者和健康个体时，达到了91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，均优于现有最佳模型（88%准确率），且模型表现稳定，训练数据随机划分情况下准确率和AUC标准差分别为0.0403和0.0174。

Conclusion: 所提方法准确且稳定，可作为大规模阿尔茨海默病筛查工具以及医生的辅助诊断手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Beyond One World基准，评估大型语言模型在扮演多版本超级英雄角色时的准确性和一致性，揭示了跨版本泛化和推理与行动匹配的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在角色扮演中难以忠实且一致地表现不同版本的角色，特别是超级英雄这种多版本多历史背景角色。

Method: 设计了包含30个标志性英雄和90个版本的基于角色的两项任务：关键事件回忆和道德困境，通过区分内部思考和外部行动来评分，并提出Think-Act Matching评分指标评估推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 链式思考提示对弱模型提升叙事连贯性但可能降低强模型的准确率；模型难以跨多个版本泛化；模型往往在思考与行动之间存在偏差，难以两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World基准揭示了当前大型语言模型在多版本角色扮演中的多元一致性和推理对齐方面存在的关键瓶颈，为未来模型改进提供了挑战和方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Motivation: 医疗大语言模型需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源有限的医疗机构的使用。

Method: 设计了包含置信度检测模块和自适应路由机制的两阶段框架，将低置信度问题分配给具备互补知识的辅助模型进行协同推理。

Result: 在三个医疗基准数据集（MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA）上验证，框架在PubMedQA（95.0%）和MedMCQA（78.0%）表现优异，优于单模型及均匀推理策略。

Conclusion: 多模型协作结合置信度驱动路由是一种实用且高效的提升医疗AI性能方案，有助于降低资源需求，促进高级医疗AI技术的普及。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 为防止LLMs在如在线考试系统中的滥用，探索其对字符级扰动的鲁棒性和应对机制。

Method: 提出了\nameshort{}方法，通过在每个输入字符后插入不可见的Unicode控制字符，制造字符级扰动，评估多种模型和场景下LLMs的表现。

Result: 尽管字符扰动严重影响了分词和信噪比，多数LLMs仍能维持较好性能。分析了LLMs对字符级分词的处理及隐式与显式去噪机制。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层次字符扰动下表现出较强鲁棒性，揭示了其潜在滥用风险及部署中需要关注的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Motivation: 现实中许多问题需要跨多个报告文档进行聚合，且对遗漏任何一篇文档非常敏感，现有单跳或多跳QA方法在此类任务上表现有限。

Method: 构建包含48个pluri-hop问题的多语种数据集PluriHopWIND；评测传统RAG模型及其变体；提出PluriHopRAG模型，将查询分解为文档级子问题，并用cross-encoder过滤无关文档以降低计算成本。

Result: PluriHopWIND数据集比现有数据集更具重复性且包含更多干扰文档，挑战较大。传统方法F1不超过40%；PluriHopRAG模型在F1上提升18%-52%。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND揭示当前问答系统在复杂重复文档集上的局限，PluriHopRAG通过细致检索和早期过滤显著提升性能，展示了其作为top-k方法替代方案的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Conclusion: 引入评论树信息为自杀风险识别提供了新的视角，提升了检测准确率，有助于早期干预策略的制定。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Result: 建立了首个YNTP任务基准，捕捉了用户真实的语言选择模式，验证了个性化语言模型方法的有效性。

Conclusion: YNTP任务和多语言对话数据集为个性化语言模型研究提供了新基准和基础，促进了用户对齐语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架，通过强化引用依赖、多轮检索验证和特定训练模块，有效提升生物医学问答系统的准确性和可信度，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学问答中，基于检索的生成方法易受检索噪声和证据验证不足影响，导致虚假信息产生，降低回答可靠性。

Method: 引入引用感知推理、迭代检索-验证过程和MedTrust-Align模块，利用负知识断言、医疗差距分析及直接偏好优化，加强证据依赖性并抑制幻觉信息。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med数据集上的实验显示，所提方法在多种模型架构下均优于竞争基线，分别提升了LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B模型2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG有效解决了生物医学问答中的幻觉问题，提高了回答的事实一致性和可靠性，有望推动医学知识问答系统的发展。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在执行多约束指令时表现欠佳，且传统强化学习方法依赖外部监督和稀疏的奖励信号，难以有效训练。

Method: 引入无标签自监督强化学习框架，直接从指令中导出奖励信号，并采用约束分解策略和高效的逐约束二分类方法解决奖励稀疏和计算效率问题。

Result: 在3个域内和5个域外数据集上均取得显著提升，表现优异，尤其在处理多轮和自主型指令时效果突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效消除对外部监督的依赖，提高了多约束指令跟随能力，具有良好的泛化能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种“探索进化”范式，通过主动探索网络并自我进化聚合程序，构建了大规模可验证训练数据WebAggregatorQA，开发了性能优异的WebAggregator模型，显著提升了网络代理的信息聚合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源网络深度研究代理主要提升信息检索能力，忽视了对信息的聚合分析，限制了深度研究支持能力。

Method: 提出"探索进化"范式，代理通过主动在线探索获取有依据的信息，然后从12种高阶逻辑操作中选择、组合和优化，生成可验证的问答对，并基于SmolAgents框架进行监督微调训练。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、跨50K网站和11领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集，开发的WebAggregator-8B模型性能可媲美GPT-4.1，32B模型性能超越GPT-4.1逾10%，在新的信息聚合评测上的表现远超其他模型。

Conclusion: 网络代理的信息聚合能力亟需加强，提出的方法有效提升了这一能力，有望推动深度网络代理在科研中的应用。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

TL;DR: NLT框架通过自然语言输出替代JSON工具调用，提升大型语言模型工具调用准确率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型中的工具调用受任务干扰和格式限制影响，导致性能下降。

Method: NLT框架通过将工具选择与响应生成解耦，以自然语言形式输出工具调用，避免了任务干扰和格式约束。

Result: NLT在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，对开源模型提升更大，且能在提示扰动下保持稳定。

Conclusion: NLT显著提升了LLM工具调用的准确性和鲁棒性，拓展了不具备本地支持模型的工具调用能力，对模型训练具有积极意义。

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA通过锚定表示和语言感知推理模块改善低资源语言的跨语言表示、检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在高资源语言上表现优异，但低资源语言因训练数据有限、翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定表现较弱。

Method: LiRA框架包括Arca模块通过锚定对齐将低资源语言映射到英语语义空间，保持表示稳定；LaSR模块在此基础上加入语言感知推理头和一致性正则化，统一训练目标，增强跨语言理解与推理能力。

Result: 在涵盖东南亚和南亚五种低资源语言的新建多语言检索数据集上，LiRA在跨语言检索、语义相似度和推理任务中表现出一致提升，并在少样本和噪声增强环境下表现更加鲁棒。消融实验验证了两个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: LiRA有效提升了低资源语言情况下大语言模型的跨语言表示能力及检索与推理性能，促进了多语言应用的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种压缩表示方法，提高了seq2seq核心指代模型在增量处理任务中的效率，同时保持了接近最先进性能的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有seq2seq核心指代模型虽然性能优越，但在处理对话等增量场景时效率和灵活性不足。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级别的token，丢弃大部分无关输入token，实现输入的压缩表示。

Result: 在OntoNotes数据集上，压缩模型性能仅比全前缀增量基线低0.6个CoNLL F1分数，但压缩率达1.8；在标注了单例提及的LitBank上，模型超过了当前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq核心指代解析中，丢弃大量无关token并进行压缩处理是一种有效的增量处理策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的数据集和分析框架，用于评估主权大型语言模型(LLMs)的社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性，指出现有主权LLMs在支持目标用户尤其是低资源语言方面存在不足，并强调需要更全面的评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对主权LLMs的关注日益增加，政府需要开发符合自身社会文化和历史背景的模型，但缺乏验证模型是否符合用户社会文化背景及其安全性和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集。

Method: 构建新数据集，提出分析框架，从社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性角度对主权LLMs进行提取和评估，并通过实验验证模型表现。

Result: 实验结果显示主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但不总能满足用户需求，且过于乐观的评价可能导致安全性等关键属性被低估。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs发展需采用更全面、基于实际的评价标准，避免低估安全等关键质量属性，保障模型符合目标用户需求。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，评估写作偏好学习模型在去除客观质量信号时的性能，发现生成式奖励模型优于传统序列奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法虽然在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在缺乏客观质量信号时性能大幅下降，难以有效捕捉主观写作质量偏好。

Method: 构建了包含1800对人类标注偏好对的数据集，涵盖8种创意写作体裁，比较了序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型评判器和生成式奖励模型的表现。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%，且模型在不同写作体裁间表现波动显著，模型规模增大未显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 现有RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误，难以捕捉主观质量偏好。成功的偏好建模可能需要加入中间推理表征而非直接分类。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RLAIF-SPA的文本到语音合成框架，通过结合强化学习和自动语音识别、语言模型技术，提升情感表达和语义准确性，实现了比现有方法更自然且情感丰富的语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到语音合成虽然在中性语音上质量接近人类，但情感表达仍不足，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或间接优化，导致生成语音情感单一且不自然。

Method: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，利用强化学习结合自动语音识别（ASR）和大语言模型（LLM）作为反馈，通过韵律标签对齐从四个维度（结构、情感、速度和语调）联合优化语义准确性和情感韵律标签匹配，增强情感表达和语音智能辨识度。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上实验结果显示，RLAIF-SPA比Chat-TTS表现更优，词错误率（WER）降低26.1%，情感相似度指数（SIM-O）提升9.1%，人类评价提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA通过引入强化学习与多维情感韵律对齐，显著提升了文本到语音合成的情感表现力和语义准确性，有效解决了情感平淡的问题。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前很多意图聚类方法依赖昂贵且不透明的商业大语言模型，且往往需预先知道聚类数量，现实应用中难以满足这些条件。

Method: 通过让大语言模型为文本生成伪标签，随后基于这些伪标签进行多标签分类，假设属于同一簇的文本共享更多标签，嵌入空间距离更近，提升聚类效果。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评测表明，该方法在效果上优于或相当于最新基线，且保持了简洁和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源有限场景，且在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，具有较好的实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过微调机器翻译模型，使其掌握中文被动结构的语义语感，提高翻译准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器翻译模型忽略了语义语感，导致字面直译词汇的负面或积极语境难以准确翻译。

Method: 以中文被动结构“被”为例，构建了英中句对数据集并标注其负面语义语感，然后对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在处理负面内容时更准确采用“被”结构，避免在中性或积极内容中误用，同时NLLB-600M模型的语义语感知识能够迁移到其他语言对。

Conclusion: 引入语义语感教学后，机器翻译模型对特定结构的翻译更精准，有助于提升多语言翻译质量。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

*Xingmeng Zhao,Dan Schumacher,Veronica Rammouz,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以人为中心的框架，利用用户故事和多代理讨论，帮助人们在AI医疗工具部署前全面思考潜在的利益与风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI医疗工具快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问的风险，且自动检测风险的方法忽略了人类对风险形成原因及影响对象的理解。

Method: 设计并验证了一种通过生成用户故事和支持多代理讨论的框架，以促进人们对AI潜在影响的全面思考。

Result: 在用户研究中，阅读用户故事的参与者能识别更多类型的伤害，且对13种伤害类型的关注更均衡；未阅读故事者则主要关注隐私和健康。

Conclusion: 讲故事的方式有效拓宽了参与者对AI潜在伤害和利益的认识，促进了更具创造性的思考。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成过程级监督的强化学习框架AutoRubric-R1V，提升多模态大语言模型的推理准确性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的强化学习仅以最终答案正确性作为奖励，导致推理过程可能存在虚假推理问题。

Method: 提出AutoRubric-R1V框架，通过自动生成基于评分标准的奖励，实现过程级自我聚合和推理检查点提取，无需人工标注，结合过程奖励和结果奖励进行训练。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准上取得了最先进的性能，同时显著提升了推理的可信度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V有效融合过程级和结果级奖励，解决了多模态推理中虚假推理的问题，提高了模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Pluto，一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）生成Verilog硬件设计效率的基准和评价框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的硬件设计自动化评估主要关注功能正确性，缺乏对面积、延迟和功耗等综合效率指标的全面评估。

Method: Pluto提供了114个问题的全面评测集，包含自检测试平台和多种帕累托最优的参考实现，用于测评LLMs生成设计的综合效率。

Result: 实验显示，尽管先进LLMs在功能正确性上达到78.3%的通过率，但其合成效率在面积、延迟和功耗指标上均明显低于专家设计，效率分别为63.8%、65.9%和64.0%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，提升硬件设计的合成效率需依赖于像Pluto这样的效率导向评估框架，推动面向硬件的LLM研究进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COIG-Writer，一个包含中文创意写作文本及其思维过程的数据集，揭示了创意写作中叙事逻辑与语言表达的双重模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在非英语创意写作中表现不足，尤其缺少过程级监督，导致创意能力受限。

Method: 构建了包含1,665个三元组（反向推导提示、详细创作推理、最终文本）的COIG-Writer数据集，覆盖51个体裁；通过实验分析创意写作的两大组成部分及其相互作用。

Result: 发现过程监督显著提升创意性能，但需与通用数据结合（至少1:12比例）；中英创意能力差异大，且词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。

Conclusion: 创意写作能力依赖于逻辑结构与语言表达的互动，过程监督为提升创意质量的关键，但无法被语言表达完全替代。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Result: 该方法展示了对答案提取规则的不敏感性，提升了模型在数学问题和开放式问答任务中的表现和稳健性。

Conclusion: 答案再生成框架通过避免依赖特定答案提取规则，提升了推理模型评估的可靠性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Motivation: 探讨哪种训练目标（对比学习或监督微调）更适合大语言模型的重排序任务及其背后机制。

Method: 统一框架将训练目标分解为权值和方向两个部分，通过实验分析两者的作用和效果，基于通用多模态检索进行对比实验。

Result: 发现监督微调提供了更强的权重更新方案，且在方向上未见显著差异，整体上监督微调优于对比学习；在MRB基准测试上通过监督微调获得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 监督微调是大语言模型重排序训练的更佳选择，研究结果和新模型有望推动该领域未来发展。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时适应框架，通过自监督优化Mixture-of-Experts模型中的专家路由决策，提升了模型在文本生成任务中的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型，且依赖外部数据，难以应用于Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）模型，且MoE模型在部署中常因分布变化导致路由决策次优。

Method: 提出了一种数据无关的在线测试时适应框架，通过在预填充阶段及生成文本过程中定期利用已生成序列进行自监督优化路由决策，采用轻量级加法向量更新路由器logits，保持计算效率和防止过拟合。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在挑战性推理任务上带来持续性能提升，如在HumanEval任务上带来5.5%的提升，并且能够与现有测试时扩展技术结合使用，例如与自一致性结合在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上取得6%的平均提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无需外部数据的在线适应，有效改进了MoE模型的路由决策，提升了文本生成任务的性能和鲁棒性，且具备良好的扩展与实用性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前中期训练作为语言模型预训练的一个阶段虽被广泛采用，但缺乏科学理解及其效果原因的系统研究。

Method: 通过从零开始预训练语言模型，并在不同领域的监督微调数据集上进行微调，比较中期训练与继续预训练的效果；以代码中期训练为例，研究中期训练起始时间和数据混合权重的影响。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域特别有效，能够减少预训练和微调数据之间的句法差距；早期引入专用数据更有利于提升领域内性能及保留通用语言模型能力；相比继续预训练，中期训练在验证损失和遗忘度上表现更优。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种有效的领域适应技术，通过减少遗忘，相较于继续预训练能够带来更好的性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR 是一个基于 MLIR 的开源编译器堆栈，专为现代空间架构如 AMD 的 NPU 设计，提供了异步和层级操作的结构化表示，实现高效的计算调度和资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算架构依赖于对数据移动、执行顺序和计算位置的细粒度控制，传统通用编译器因抽象掉这些细节而限制了性能，需开发新的编译器基础设施以充分利用空间架构。

Method: 引入 MLIR-AIR 和 AIR 方言，定义异步和层级操作的结构化语义，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信与计算重叠，无需手动调度或运行时协调。通过矩阵乘法和 LLaMA 2 多头注意力模块进行验证。

Result: 在矩阵乘法上，MLIR-AIR 达到 78.7% 计算效率，性能接近最高优化的底层 MLIR-AIE 实现；在多头注意力上，仅用约 150 行代码实现高效融合，简化复杂工作负载表达。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR 成功将高层结构化控制流转化为空间程序，利用异步执行、分块和通信重叠，通过编译器管理的调度高效利用 NPU 的计算和存储层次结构。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Result: 实验显示，所合并模型在回答相似度上较基线模型提升了约47.5%，显著增强了输出的一致性。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业级检索增强生成系统提供了提升生成输出一致性的实用解决方案，显著提高了系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了训练计算与上下文利用之间的关系，为设计高效的长上下文大型语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于最后一个token自奖励的强化学习方法LaSeR，以提高大语言模型在推理任务中的表现和自验证能力，显著提升推理效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）的方法在测试阶段缺乏验证信号，且通常需要分别利用两个提示模板生成解答及自验证，导致效率低下。作者希望提升效率并统一推理和自验证过程。

Method: 论文理论推导出自验证的RL目标的闭式解，即解答的真实推理奖励等于其最后一个token的自奖励得分。基于此，提出LaSeR算法，通过在RLVR损失中加入均方误差损失，使最后token自奖励得分与验证器推理奖励对齐，联合优化推理及自奖励能力。该得分可在训练和测试中使用，只需额外执行一次token推断，计算成本极低。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

Motivation: 多模态生成模型在面对方言文本输入时性能下降，如何提升模型对英语方言的生成能力是挑战。

Method: 构建包含六种英语方言的大规模基准数据集，设计基于编码器的泛化策略，使模型学会识别新的方言特征，同时保护标准美式英语表现。

Result: 在4200多个方言提示和17个生成模型上测试，现有方法提升有限（<7%），但提出的编码器策略在Stable Diffusion 1.5模型上使五种方言表现提升34.4%，标准英语性能几乎无下降。

Conclusion: 所提编码器策略有效解决了多模态生成模型在处理英语方言文本时性能下降的问题，实现了对方言的适应能力提升与标准英语表现的平衡。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的强化学习方法在多轮交互中面临奖励稀疏、优势崩溃和缺乏细粒度归因的问题，导致学习信号不足，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出信息增益策略优化（IGPO）框架，将每个交互回合视为信息获取的递增过程，定义回合级奖励为模型生成正确答案概率的边际增加，结合结局奖励形成密集的奖励轨迹，无需依赖外部奖励模型或昂贵的蒙特卡洛估计。

Result: 在多个领域内外的基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下始终优于强基线，表现出更高的准确率和更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在信息增益奖励有效缓解了多轮强化学习的关键难题，为提升大语言模型工具使用能力提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集多样化、大规模的UI轨迹数据以提升数字代理的泛化能力成本过高，亟需一种高效的数据合成方法。

Method: 提出UI-Simulator，其集成数字世界模拟器、多样化UI状态生成、引导式轨迹展开以及轨迹包装器来合成高质量、多样化的训练轨迹；并设计UI-Simulator-Grow策略，通过优先选择高影响任务和生成信息丰富的轨迹变体来实现快速数据扩展。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld平台实验中，UI-Simulator在使用较弱教师模型的情况下，其表现不亚于甚至优于基于真实UI数据训练的开源代理，且更加鲁棒；UI-Simulator-Grow以较小模型为基础，达成了与大规模模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: UI-Simulator及其规模扩展策略UI-Simulator-Grow展示了通过针对性轨迹合成扩展，实现高效且连续提升数字代理性能的潜力，降低了对真实数据收集的依赖。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

TL;DR: 提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应刷新KV缓存，显著减少扩散大语言模型解码时的冗余计算，实现加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法每次解码时都会重新计算所有token的QKV，存在大量冗余，尤其是浅层和远端的MASK token，这导致解码延迟高且效率低。

Method: 基于3个关键观察，Elastic-Cache通过注意力感知的漂移检测决定何时刷新缓存，并依据深度选择自适应地刷新某些层的KV缓存，同时重用浅层及窗口外的MASK缓存，无需训练且架构无关。

Result: 在LLaDA系列模型上，Elastic-Cache在数学推理和代码生成任务中实现了8.7至45.1倍的解码加速，同时保持甚至提升了准确率，相比旧方法也有显著的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache有效减少了扩散LLM的解码冗余计算，实现更高效率和准确性，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large
language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and
context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into
shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising
near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such
systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework
to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to
three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We
derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,
(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the
achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify
regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between
agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either
resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of
experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical
outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.
Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable
multi-agent reasoning systems.

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt,
and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering
multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities
for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current
simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by
predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These
limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies.
In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally
inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures
that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as
balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling
to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving
field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness,
continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI
ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms
and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent
simulations.}

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) unlock new potentials in
distributed reasoning, collaboration, and task generalization but also
introduce additional risks due to unguaranteed agreement, cascading
uncertainty, and adversarial vulnerabilities. We argue that ensuring
responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local,
superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We
conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide
property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the
complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective
verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that
combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is
essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as
unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to
support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned,
verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide
agreement.

Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs)
explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where
pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work
has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and
simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool
resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly
tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without
full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,
communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that
removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:
social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and
norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.
Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,
and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge
endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key
findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine
norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social
initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and
benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these
conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining
cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed
for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can
inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,
where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and
effective governance of AI-mediated environments.

Abstract: The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an ``Age

the transition from prototype to production is hindered by a pervasive ``crisis

untrustworthy in mission-critical applications. This paper argues this crisis
stems from a fundamental paradigm mismatch -- attempting to command inherently
probabilistic processors with the deterministic mental models of traditional
software engineering. To solve this crisis, we introduce a governance-first
paradigm for principled agent engineering, embodied in a formal architecture we
call ArbiterOS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准多集中于单轮编码任务，忽视了真实开发中多轮迭代的复杂性，难以全面评估代码生成模型的实际表现。

Method: MT-Sec通过将现有单轮任务转变为多轮语义对齐的交互序列，结合原有测试套件，系统评估了32个开闭源模型及三种代理框架在多轮代码生成和代码差分生成中的表现。

Result: 多轮任务中，"正确且安全"代码输出率较单轮下降20-27%；多轮代码差分生成表现更差，功能错误和安全缺陷增加；代理框架虽提升了单轮表现，但多轮效果有限。

Conclusion: 多轮真实编码流程下，代码生成模型在正确性和安全性方面存在显著挑战，亟需开发综合评估这两方面能力的新基准。

Abstract: AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed
software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing
benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they
are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative
nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to
systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding
scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms
existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction
sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity
of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models,
and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in
"correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even
among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate
models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically
relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased
rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that
while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they
are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings
highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and
security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成网页界面时往往复制训练数据中的无障碍缺陷，导致部分用户被排除。

Method: 引入A11yn方法，基于违反WCAG规范的严重程度设计奖励函数，训练模型生成更无障碍的网页UI，同时构建了7千指令的数据集UIReq-6.8K和300条真实请求的评测集RealUIReq-300。

Conclusion: 通过系统性优化奖励函数，可以有效提升代码生成大模型输出的网页界面的无障碍性，证明代码生成无障碍对齐的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating functional and aesthetic web interfaces directly from
instructions. However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from
their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse
needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method
that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant
web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the
severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To
support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse
instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300,
a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated
from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results
show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the
Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic
fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that
accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the
feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在软件开发中的广泛应用使其成为后门攻击的主要目标，且现有的谱特征防御方法在代码模型上的效果存在不足，亟需深入研究和优化。

Method: 系统评估了不同攻击情境和防御配置下谱特征方法的效果，分析其优劣，重点探讨了关键参数设置对检测性能的影响，并提出了一个新的代理指标来准确估计检测效果。

Result: 发现了当前广泛采用的谱特征检测设置在代码模型中通常不够理想，通过调整关键因素改善了性能，并提出的代理指标无需重新训练模型即可更准确评价防御效果。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks.
Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to
manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data.
Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the
use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by
analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works
have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks,
recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for
code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral
Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We
systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and
defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found
that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection
is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the
key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate
the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the
defense.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BugStone系统，利用LLVM和大型语言模型识别并修复软件中重复出现但未解决的漏洞模式，显著提升漏洞检测效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型程序中，类似代码段中存在未被发现和修复的重复漏洞，这些漏洞增加了安全风险且手动修复耗时耗力。

Method: 基于已修复的单一漏洞实例，利用BugStone系统通过LLVM和大型语言模型识别该漏洞的共性错误模式，进而在整个程序中搜索类似的潜在漏洞。

Result: BugStone从Linux内核135个唯一漏洞模式出发，发现了超过2.2万个潜在漏洞；人工验证了400个实例，有246个为真实漏洞。该系统在构建的数据集中达成92.2%的精度和79.1%的成对准确率。

Conclusion: BugStone有效发现并验证了软件中广泛存在的重复模式漏洞，提升了漏洞检测的自动化和精准度，有助于增强软件安全性。

Abstract: Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial
time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project
maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the
issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,
which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and
fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more
concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they
provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other
parts of the program.
  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear
repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different
programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our
investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise
the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program
analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key
observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged
to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By
examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify
similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,
BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.
Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also
created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier
conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring
patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice,
BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出NL2Scenic数据集和框架，用于自然语言到Scenic代码生成，评估了13款模型，发现中型开源模型在自动驾驶场景编程中具实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言转Scenic代码生成存在数据匮乏、复现性差和评价指标不一致的问题。

Method: 构建包含146对NL/Scenic数据的开放数据集NL2Scenic，设计难度分层测试集，提出Example Retriever和14种提示词策略，评估13款模型并综合多种文本及执行指标，开发新的评价指标EDIT-COMP。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，Qwen2.5Coder-14B在本地硬件上达到88%的专家评分，检索增强提示和少样本提示能提升小模型性能，模型规模扩大收益递减，中型模型效果优于同规模模型。

Conclusion: NL2Scenic和EDIT-COMP为Scenic代码生成提供了标准化评测基础，中型开源模型是自动驾驶场景代码生成的实用且经济高效方案。

Abstract: Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic,
a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible
scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs)
suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We
introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a
difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14
prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four
proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine
open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using
text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics
(compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11).
EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of
EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking
fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88
percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting,
Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and
scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder
outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a
standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and
indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options
for autonomous-driving scenario programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建命令行工具的部分规范繁琐易错，限制了相关系统的实用性。

Method: Caruca利用大语言模型将命令文档转换为结构化调用语法，遍历合法调用及环境组合，实际执行并监控系统调用和文件系统，自动提取命令的关键属性。

Result: 在60个GNU Coreutils、POSIX及第三方命令上测试，Caruca生成了几乎全部正确规范，免除人工劳动，支持先进的静态分析工具。

Conclusion: Caruca有效解决了自动生成命令规范的问题，提高了系统分析工具的自动化和准确性，提升了相关技术的实用价值。

Abstract: A wealth of state-of-the-art systems demonstrate impressive improvements in
performance, security, and reliability on programs composed of opaque
components, such as Unix shell commands. To reason about commands, these
systems require partial specifications. However, creating such specifications
is a manual, laborious, and error-prone process, limiting the practicality of
these systems. This paper presents Caruca, a system for automatic specification
mining for opaque commands. To overcome the challenge of language diversity
across commands, Caruca first instruments a large language model to translate a
command's user-facing documentation into a structured invocation syntax. Using
this representation, Caruca explores the space of syntactically valid command
invocations and execution environments. Caruca concretely executes each
command-environment pair, interposing at the system-call and filesystem level
to extract key command properties such as parallelizability and filesystem pre-
and post-conditions. These properties can be exported in multiple specification
formats and are immediately usable by existing systems. Applying Caruca across
60 GNU Coreutils, POSIX, and third-party commands across several
specification-dependent systems shows that Caruca generates correct
specifications for all but one case, completely eliminating manual effort from
the process and currently powering the full specifications for a
state-of-the-art static analysis tool.

TL;DR: 提出一个混合知识指导进化框架，实现个性化编译器优化序列，显著提升软件性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器优化序列选择是NP难题，传统通用优化难以发挥程序最大性能。

Method: 构建包含行为向量、行为聚类组、协同优化图和原型序列库的大规模离线知识库，结合在线个性化的基于知识的遗传算法优化。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上，平均比LLVM opt -Oz优化减少11%的IR指令，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效发现个性化高性能优化序列，优于传统通用优化策略。

Abstract: Compiler pass auto-tuning is critical for enhancing software performance, yet
finding the optimal pass sequence for a specific program is an NP-hard problem.
Traditional, general-purpose optimization flags like -O3 and -Oz adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to unlock a program's full
performance potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid,
Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework. This framework intelligently guides
online, personalized optimization using knowledge extracted from a large-scale
offline analysis phase. During the offline stage, we construct a comprehensive
compilation knowledge base composed of four key components: (1) Pass Behavioral
Vectors to quantitatively capture the effectiveness of each optimization; (2)
Pass Groups derived from clustering these vectors based on behavior similarity;
(3) a Synergy Pass Graph to model beneficial sequential interactions; and (4) a
library of Prototype Pass Sequences evolved for distinct program types. In the
online stage, a bespoke genetic algorithm leverages this rich knowledge base
through specially designed, knowledge-infused genetic operators. These
operators transform the search by performing semantically-aware recombination
and targeted, restorative mutations. On a suite of seven public datasets, our
framework achieves an average of 11.0% additional LLVM IR instruction reduction
over the highly-optimized opt -Oz baseline, demonstrating its state-of-the-art
capability in discovering personalized, high-performance optimization
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TLE错误难以诊断和修复，现有工具支持不足，导致用户频繁失败甚至放弃提交。需要深入分析TLE根因并提出有效自动修复方案。

Method: 手动分析1000条Codeforces带TLE的提交，分类错误根因，追踪修复尝试；基于结果设计Nettle工具，结合大模型和编译器测试反馈，自动生成小规模正确代码修改；设计Nettle-Eval框架验证修复有效性。

Result: TLE错误不仅源自效率低下算法，还包括死循环、数据结构使用不当和低效I/O。Nettle在1000个真实案例中修复率98.5%，远超现有大模型基线，修复结果通过所有验证。

Conclusion: TLE错误成因复杂，自动修复需综合多方面信息。Nettle及其评估框架显著提升了TLE修复的自动化和准确性，为在线编程平台用户提供强有力的错误修复支持。

Abstract: Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions
of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry
interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)
error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although
designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error
messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and
existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon
their submissions after repeated TLE failures.
  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in
online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE
errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix
them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient
algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and
inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely
performance issues.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair
tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework
for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback
generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code
edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same
1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the
strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the
platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.

Result: 实验证明，PathFix在处理复杂程序结构如循环和递归时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathFix有效提升了自动程序修复的准确性和效率，特别适用于复杂程序的缺陷修复。

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable
defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness.
However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing
APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch
candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages
path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate
patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy
program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the
fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First,
it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second,
it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the
control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads
to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by
solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the
correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and
mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate
a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that
PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex
program structures such as loops and recursion.

Motivation: 现有的测试生成方法依赖静态数据集，存在难度固定的天花板，难以发现训练范围之外的新型或复杂错误。

Method: ATGen通过对抗性强化学习，将测试生成器与对抗代码生成器对抗，后者不断生成更难的错误以挑战当前策略，从而形成难度递增的训练课程，测试生成器通过强化学习优化以最大化输出准确性和攻击成功率。

Result: 实验表明，ATGen显著优于现有最先进方法，并且能更有效地筛选最佳输出以及为代码生成模型提供高质量奖励。

Conclusion: ATGen建立了一种动态提升大型语言模型代码可靠性的新范式，突破了静态训练的难度限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs
often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical
bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or
supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a
``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover
novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we
introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial
reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code
generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy.
This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging
current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to
learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling
of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical
utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N
inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation
models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the
reliability of LLM-generated code.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in software engineering and cybersecurity tasks, including code generation,
vulnerability discovery, and automated testing. One critical but underexplored
application is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms
vulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest
promising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web
vulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web
vulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software
engineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including
technical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors,
on 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three
top-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation
on our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types
and 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve
reasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently
fail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component
environments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers
create a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual
vulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with
performance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.
Our findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent
capabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,
emphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous
problem-solving capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链攻击虽罕见但破坏性强，自动化检测恶意代码注入难以仅凭代码及上下文判断意图。

Method: 通过名称预测基础的凝聚力指标（NPC）量化代码内聚力变化，比较恶意代码注入和自然功能更新的差异。

Result: 分析54,707个函数发现注入代码导致凝聚力下降，命名趋向短且描述性差。针对极端不平衡测试集，高凝聚力函数监测实现了较高的精准率。

Conclusion: 名称预测的函数凝聚力度量可有效辅助检测供应链攻击，增强源代码完整性保障。

Abstract: Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious
code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may
have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated
tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of
both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an
unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying
cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion
(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is
introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707
functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection
reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive
names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of
real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme
test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC
can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100
of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that
automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based
cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving
source code integrity.

Motivation: 传统上，ISA迁移主要聚焦于二进制翻译，但随着开源生态的发展，直接重编译成为可能，带来了新的挑战，因此需要重新审视迁移任务和方法。

Method: 通过分析Google近40,000次代码提交的x86到Arm迁移案例，归纳迁移任务分类，展示自动化过程，并探讨AI辅助迁移的应用。

Result: 揭示了ISA迁移任务的多样性和复杂性，Google成功自动化了许多步骤，证明AI可显著促进迁移效率，同时识别出依旧难以自动化的任务。

Conclusion: 现代ISA迁移不仅是二进制翻译问题，而是多任务系统工程，自动化和AI技术在迁移中发挥重要作用，但仍有研究空间，需关注未解决的挑战。

Abstract: Migrating codebases from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another is
a major engineering challenge. A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in
addition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has
seen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on
static and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom
has been that this is the primary challenge.
  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations
can often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to
recompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and
multifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.
  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning
almost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA
migration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and
demonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these
tasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research
challenges that warrant further attention.
