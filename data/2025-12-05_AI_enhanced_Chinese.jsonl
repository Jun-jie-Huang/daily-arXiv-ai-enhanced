However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning. On the other hand, fine-tuning CodeBERT yields higher performance (F1 score: 91.22%, partial match accuracy: 91.30%) but requires additional training, maintenance effort, and resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gemini-1.5-Flash\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u572820\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8674.05%\u7684F1\u5f97\u5206\u548c83.90%\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e5f\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Gemini\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684CodeBERT\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluation systems, neither traditional tests for humans nor benchmarks for LLMs, fail to capture this shift. They remain focused on well-defined algorithmic problems, which excludes problems where success depends on human-AI collaboration. Such collaborative problems not only require human reasoning to interpret complex contexts and guide solution strategies, but also demand AI efficiency for implementation. To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its \"Collaboration-Necessary\" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%. Our analysis reveals an emerging co-reasoning partnership. This finding challenges the traditional human-tool hierarchy by showing that strategic breakthroughs can originate from either humans or AI. HAI-Eval establishes not only a challenging benchmark for next-generation coding agents but also a grounded, scalable framework for assessing core developer competencies in the AI era. Our benchmark and interactive demo will be openly accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "HAI-Eval\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5173\u6ce8\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8645\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u5fc5\u9700\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316IDE\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c45\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e0e5\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u57284\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u72ec\u7acbLLM\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff080.67%\u548c18.89%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f331.11%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5171\u63a8\u7406\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "HAI-Eval\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u4f5c\u5fc5\u9700\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports.

Investigation processes followed by on-call engineers are often manual or rely on ad-hoc scripts. This leads to inefficient investigations resulting in increased time to mitigate and isolate failures/SLO violations. It also contributes to on-call toil and poor productivity leading to multiple hours/days spent in triaging/debugging incidents. In this paper, we present DrP, an end-to-end framework and system to automate investigations that reduces the mean time to resolve incidents (MTTR) and reduces on-call toil. DrP consists of an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks in code (called analyzers), a scalable backend system to execute these automated playbooks, plug-ins to integrate playbooks into mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools, and a post-processing system to take actions on investigations including mitigation steps.\n  We have implemented and deployed DrP at large scale at Meta covering 300+ teams, 2000+ analyzers, across a large set of use cases across domains such as services, core infrastructure, AI/ML, hardware, mobile. DrP has been running in production for the past 5 years and executes 50K automated analyses per day. Overall, our results and experience show that DrP has been able to reduce average MTTR by 20 percent at large scale (with over 80 percent for some teams) and has significantly improved on-call productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Meta\u5f00\u53d1\u7684DrP\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u6545\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5df2\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6295\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u67e5\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u65f6\u811a\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86DrP\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7075\u6d3b\u7684SDK\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u5199\u8c03\u67e5\u5267\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e3b\u6d41\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "DrP\u5df2\u5728Meta\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8986\u76d6300+\u56e2\u961f\uff0c2000+\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u6267\u884c5\u4e07\u6b21\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MTTR\u964d\u4f4e20%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u56e2\u961f\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc780%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u503c\u73ed\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DrP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\uff08MTTR\uff09\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u503c\u73ed\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u7684\u534a\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u67b6\u6784SEMI-CTDE\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8def\u53e3\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u7eaf\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u7eaf\u5206\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u5168\u5206\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u5212\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5185\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u53ca\u533a\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u67b6\u6784SEMI-CTDE\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u7684\u67b6\u6784SEMI-CTDE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u548c\u5168\u5206\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SEMI-CTDE\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5316\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8def\u53e3\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B.

The rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot has transformed how software is learned and written. In software engineering (SE) education, these tools offer new opportunities for support, but also raise concerns about over-reliance, ethical use, and impacts on learning. Objective. This study investigates how undergraduate SE students use GenAI tools, focusing on the benefits, challenges, ethical concerns, and instructional expectations that shape their experiences. Method. We conducted a survey with 130 undergraduate students from two universities. The survey combined structured Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to investigate five dimensions: usage context, perceived benefits, challenges, ethical and instructional perceptions. Results. Students most often use GenAI for incremental learning and advanced implementation, reporting benefits such as brainstorming support and confidence-building.

Where $\u03b5$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $\u03b5$-machines and diffusion models.

The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification.

Published in Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC). DOI: 10.1109/VL-HCC65237.2025.00024", "summary": "Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation.

This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation.

The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials.

We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities.

While existing research benchmarks functional correctness (pass@k), this study presents the first empirical framework to measure \"Architectural Erosion\" and the accumulation of Technical Debt in AI-synthesized microservices. We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints.

We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains.

In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others. However, with MANTRA, the performance of all models in both tasks is improved. MANTRA enables researchers and practitioners to reduce the impact of errors introduced by the dataset in training, saves time in data cleaning and processing, while maximizing the effect of fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MANTRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u5206\u6790\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MANTRA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee3\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PTM\uff09\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528MANTRA\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u8fd8\u662f\u63d0\u4ea4\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MANTRA\u6846\u67b6\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time.

First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode.

Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MASE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7NLGP\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u540e\u7f6e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\uff08NLGP\uff09\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMASE\u5728Delta\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MASE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced.

In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators.

It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy.

However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM.

To address these challenges, we propose MSME, a Multi-Stage, Multi-Expert framework for zero-shot stance detection. MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction.

This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines.

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u68b3\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u76ca\u5904\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "SAS\u9700\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0eSAS\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c06GenAI\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3aSAS\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76ee\u524d\u6b64\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6280\u672f\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u5176\u76ca\u5904\u4e0e\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u76ca\u5904\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347SAS\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eMAPE-K\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u5206\u6790\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u529f\u80fd\uff09\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u4e0eSAS\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73af\u573a\u666f\uff09", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5c06GenAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSAS\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76ca\u5904\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u524dGenAI\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565", "conclusion": "\u5c06GenAI\u6574\u5408\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u867d\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u9879\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u6700\u5927\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion.

Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPOLARIS\u4e09\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u542f\u81ea\u9002\u5e943.0\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u6cbb\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOLARIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u900f\u660e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b\u5143\u5c42\u8bb0\u5f55\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\uff08SWIM\u548cSWITCH\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPOLARIS\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "POLARIS\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411Self-Adaptation 3.0\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5373\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0cAdmTree\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u727a\u7272\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdmTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5272\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6458\u8981\u6807\u8bb0\u603b\u7ed3\u53d8\u957f\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u3002", "result": "AdmTree\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5c42\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "AdmTree\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, configuring Kubernetes is prone to errors. Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts.

We conduct evaluations on 11 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning reasoning, reading comprehension, code generation, and instruction following, we find that ADAPT matches or slightly improves average downstream performance relative to the best static mixture, while using fewer effective training tokens and reallocating budget toward harder, benchmark-aligned tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADAPT\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316token\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0cADAPT\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "ADAPT\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "ADAPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u660e\u786e\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591atoken\u5230\u6709\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f0a\u7aef\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7ea610\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u57281%\u30015%\u300110%\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec320\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u6307\u4ee4\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5bf911\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cADAPT\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3token\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u9759\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u7565\u4f18\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ed9\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u4e14\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ADAPT\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3token\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u52a0\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals.

The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations. These findings provide a solid basis for aligning linguistic stimuli in psy-cholinguistic studies more closely with real-world language use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u5fb7\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9633\u6027\u8bcd\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5e76\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee3\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u9633\u6027\u8bcd\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u6027\u522b\u4e2d\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf921\u4e2a\u9633\u6027\u4e2a\u4eba\u540d\u8bcd\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u8bcd\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5171\u6807\u6ce86195\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7528\u6cd5\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u9633\u6027\u8bcd\u5728\u590d\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\uff0c\u6d88\u6781\u89d2\u8272\u540d\u8bcd\u548c\u58f0\u671b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u540d\u8bcd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7528\u6cd5\u5e76\u975e\u5982\u4e4b\u524d\u89c2\u70b9\u6240\u8a00\u4e3b\u8981\u6307\u4ee3\u6574\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u7528\u9633\u6027\u8bcd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5e76\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u6574\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6750\u6599\u3002"}}

While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation.

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models. For instance, on the MATH500 task, TTSV achieves a 45.88% relative performance gain on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% relative gain on the Qwen3-4B model.

Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684Edit-then-Consolidate\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014Edit-then-Consolidate\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT)\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u9650\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cEdit-then-Consolidate\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Edit-then-Consolidate\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002"}}

Yet, systematic evaluation of these models, especially for languages beyond English, remains limited. \"Challenging the Abilities of LAnguage Models in ITAlian\" (CALAMITA) is a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative for Italian, coordinated under the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation.

We first analyze the most common errors found in written Danish. Based on this analysis, we introduce a set of fourteen corruption functions that generate incorrect sentences by systematically introducing errors into existing correct Danish sentences. To ensure the accuracy of these corruptions, we assess their validity using both manual and automatic methods. The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones. Our results also suggest that our benchmark has a higher discriminatory power which allows to better distinguish well-performing models from low-performing ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e39\u9ea6\u8bed\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b14\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e39\u9ea6\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4e66\u9762\u4e39\u9ea6\u8bed\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8614\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8150\u8d25\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u53e5\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6784\u9020\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u533a\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges.

We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning.

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6SEAL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u6307\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SEAL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5c0fS\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u5757\u4fee\u6b63\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u677f\u5b8c\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6267\u884cS\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3002", "result": "SEAL\u5728SPICE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAL\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance.

However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis. We train Nex-N1 upon the diverse and complex interactive environments established by our infrastructure. Empirical results on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 demonstrate that Nex-N1 consistently outperforms SOTA open-source models and achieves competitive performance against frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks.

Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u591a\u4f59\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u7684Arbitrage\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u88ab\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u6d6a\u8d39\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b64\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u7684Arbitrage Oracle\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArbitrage\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b65\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6458\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u7ea62\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Arbitrage\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u4f55\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6b65\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm.
