Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench."}

Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.\n  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.\n  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends.

We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery."}

Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge). Finally, these rules are incorporated into a compiler that can automatically apply them wherever applicable, eliminating repeated reliance on LLMs (deployment). We demonstrate that RuleFlow is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) Pandas optimization framework on PandasBench, a challenging Pandas benchmark consisting of Python notebooks. Across these notebooks, we achieve a speedup of up to 4.3x over Dias, the previous compiler-based SOTA, and 1914.9x over Modin, the previous systems-based SOTA.\n  Our code is available at https://github.com/ADAPT-uiuc/RuleFlow."}

We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations. This work represents an initial step toward process-oriented approaches to measuring inclusion in human-AI collaborative learning environments."}

Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics."}

While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes."}

However, existing approaches often rely heavily on README files and other metadata, which are frequently missing, limiting their applicability in real-world large-scale settings. We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding."}

In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations. According to our experiments, our model consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in handling lengthy and intricate conversations. This unique capability offers us an opportunity to ensure the responsible and interpretable use of LLMs."}

Our method requires no auxiliary models or external annotation, instead importance is estimated directly from the policy model's own probability shifts. Experiments on GSM8K across three models spanning the Qwen and Llama families demonstrate consistent improvements over uniform baselines and faster convergence to equivalent accuracy. Inverting the importance signal hurts performance, confirming we capture genuine causal structure rather than noise. Analysis shows the method correctly prioritizes calculation steps over scaffolding text. We view these findings as establishing counterfactual importance weighting as a foundation for further research rather than a complete solution."}

However, there is still a lack of rigor in describing controlled experiments, hindering reproducibility and transparency. Registered Reports (RR) have been discussed in the ESE community to address these issues. A RR registers a study's hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses before execution, involving peer review and potential acceptance before data collection. This helps mitigate problematic practices such as p-hacking, publication bias, and inappropriate post hoc analysis. Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential."}

Yet some tests suffer from flakiness, where their outcomes vary non-deterministically. Flakiness erodes developer trust in test results, wastes computational resources, and undermines CI reliability. While prior research has examined test flakiness within individual projects, its broader ecosystem-wide impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study of test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, which focuses on (1) cross-project flakiness, where flaky tests impact multiple projects, and (2) inconsistent flakiness, where a test exhibits flakiness in some projects but remains stable in others. By analyzing 649 OpenStack projects, we identify 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests. We find that cross-project flakiness affects 55% of OpenStack projects and significantly increases both review time and computational costs. Surprisingly, 70% of unit tests exhibit cross-project flakiness, challenging the assumption that unit tests are inherently insulated from issues that span modules like integration and system-level tests. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that race conditions in CI, inconsistent build configurations, and dependency mismatches are the primary causes of inconsistent flakiness. These findings underline the need for better coordination across complex ecosystems, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies."}

To further characterize affective patterns, we apply emotion labeling using a BERT-based classifier and visualize emotional profiles across dimensions. Our findings reveal five empirically derived experiential dimensions of AI-related psychological risk grounded in real-world user discourse, with self-regulation difficulties emerging as the most prevalent and fear concentrated in concerns related to autonomy, control, and technical risk.

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems.

Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish."}

We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods."}

In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented)."}

Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction.

We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary.

Using this dataset, the Mistral Codestral model was evaluated with CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics to measure lexical and semantic similarity as well as migration correctness. Results show that the evaluated model (Mistral Codestral) can handle trivial one-to-one API substitutions with moderate success, achieving identical migrations in 11.11% of the cases, but it struggles with more complex migrations such as CORBA or JAX-WS.

Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs."}

In this work, inspired by Equivalence Modulo Inputs (EMI), we propose Quantum EMI (QEMI), a new testing approach for QSSes. Our key contributions include: (1) a random quantum program generator that produces code with dead code based on quantum control-flow structures, and (2) an adaptation of the EMI technique from classical compiler testing to generate variants by removing dead code. By comparing the behavior of these variants, we can detect potential bugs in QSS implementations. We applied QEMI to Qiskit, Q#, and Cirq, and successfully identified 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency. QEMI expands the limited set of testing techniques available for quantum software stacks by going beyond structural transformations and incorporating semantics-preserving ones into quantum program analysis."}

However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods."}

In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration. To understand the current landscape and challenges, we first provide an overview of the status of automated environment construction. We then propose a novel framework paradigm that tightly integrates automated environment setup with the code migration workflow. Finally, we explore the challenges and future directions for automated environment interaction within the code migration domain.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off."}

However, the current manual process is labor-intensive, and hence, done only as a one-time assessment for a subset of all papers. To support the artifact evaluation effort, we present Artisan, an automated LLM agent for reproducing research results given a paper and its artifact. The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages. We validate all tasks in Artisan-Bench for reproducibility to ensure that the tasks are feasible. Our experiments show that Artisan is effective, producing 44/60 reproduction scripts and outperforming the best available baseline, a vanilla LLM agent (mini-swe-agent), by 3.14$\\times$ in terms of reproduction scripts generated while taking $0.45 and 48 minutes, on average per task.

We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining."}

While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts.

To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs."}

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment.

This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks."}

To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS).

Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities."}

In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation.

This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance."}

To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define \"uniqueness\" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history."}

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC."}

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions."}

Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses.

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains."}

In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models."}

We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis."}

We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production."}

We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates."}

Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms."}

To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment.

By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps.

We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here."}

However, current artificial intelligence (AI) systems struggle to consistently demonstrate such capabilities. The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \\& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \\& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks."}

Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench."}

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development."}

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.
