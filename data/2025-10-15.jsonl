In common eye-tracking\nstudies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets\nsuch as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods\nto extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here,\nresearchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code\nblocks, and the difference leads to different results.

Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems.

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability.

The fine-tuned top-performing model\nsurpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation\ndomain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we\nprovide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic\ndomain and long-context translation."}

In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt\nengineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands\nfor Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the\n'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR\nframework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its\nperformance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,\nparticularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.\nThrough a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most\n8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance\nthe output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,\nalthough its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the\nLlama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with\nCOSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability\nand scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in\ncomputationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware."}

However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic\nmatching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral\nevidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of\nrationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,\nwe propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet\neffective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with\ntask-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.\nExperiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR\nperformance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest\nthat large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based\nautomatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning\npatterns."}

With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions."}

This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to\nassess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,\nRecombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)\ngenerates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue\nand continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined\nsequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and\nenables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we\nfind that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect\nenhanced in instruct-tuned models.

Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building\nbenchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating\ntoken-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our\nvision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in\nnoisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable\nLLM--data integration."}
