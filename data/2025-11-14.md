### [1] [Omnilingual ASR: Open-Source Multilingual Speech Recognition for 1600+ Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09690)
*Omnilingual ASR team,Gil Keren,Artyom Kozhevnikov,Yen Meng,Christophe Ropers,Matthew Setzler,Skyler Wang,Ife Adebara,Michael Auli,Can Balioglu,Kevin Chan,Chierh Cheng,Joe Chuang,Caley Droof,Mark Duppenthaler,Paul-Ambroise Duquenne,Alexander Erben,Cynthia Gao,Gabriel Mejia Gonzalez,Kehan Lyu,Sagar Miglani,Vineel Pratap,Kaushik Ram Sadagopan,Safiyyah Saleem,Arina Turkatenko,Albert Ventayol-Boada,Zheng-Xin Yong,Yu-An Chung,Jean Maillard,Rashel Moritz,Alexandre Mourachko,Mary Williamson,Shireen Yates*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omnilingual ASR，一种支持1600多种语言的大规模可扩展自动语音识别系统，尤其增强了对低资源语言的支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动语音识别系统主要支持资源丰富的语言，大量长尾语言依然没有覆盖，扩展成本高且受限于架构设计与伦理问题。

Method: 设计了基于70亿参数的自监督预训练模型和受大语言模型启发的编码器-解码器架构，实现零样本泛化能力；结合公共资源和社区录音构建多样化训练语料。

Result: 成功支持超过1600种语言，其中500多种为首次被自动语音识别覆盖，在低资源条件下表现显著优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 开放源代码的Omnilingual ASR降低了研究者和社区的进入门槛，促进了多语言语音技术的普及与社区参与，具备积极的社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了示例选择和排序对大语言模型上下文学习性能的影响，发现示例排序的重要性与选择相当，强调在提示设计中两者同等重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究普遍认为示例选择对上下文学习性能影响远大于示例排序，作者旨在重新检验这一假设。

Method: 通过在分类和生成任务上，对多个开源模型及GPT-5，采用控制实验对比不同示例选择和排序带来的性能变化。

Result: 实验结果表明不同示例排序导致的性能差异与不同示例集带来的差异相当，可通过开发集识别强排序，接近基于测试标签的最优排序效果。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序对上下文学习性能同样关键，提示设计应同时关注两者，需重新审视上下文学习中的既有假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了形态学驱动的分词方法在拉丁语上的应用，发现其显著提升了下游任务的表现，尤其是在领域外文本上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法侧重信息理论目标，未充分考虑形态学对分词的影响，尤其是对形态复杂语言的下游性能有负面影响。

Method: 采用形态学知识指导拉丁语分词，利用丰富的词汇资源来优化分词过程，提高模型预训练效果。

Result: 在四个下游任务中，形态学驱动的分词显著提升了性能，尤其增强了模型处理领域外文本的能力。

Conclusion: 利用语言学资源，特别是形态学信息，可以有效提升形态复杂且数据资源有限语言的语言模型表现，是数据不足情况下的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估NLP技术在分析大量政治文本，特别是总统指令中的信号主题识别的有效性和实用性。

Method: 通过NLP技术和人工分析对里根至克林顿时期总统指令中的信号主题进行识别和比较。

Result: NLP和人工分析均能识别相关文件，显示NLP在大量文本研究中的潜力，但两者结果存在差异，提示NLP准确性需进一步验证。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP在分析大型文本数据方面展示了潜力，但现有工具可能有局限，未来需进一步研究和改进以确保其在社会科学应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在英德关键错误检测任务中，如何使用小型大语言模型（参数规模低于20亿）在保持准确度的同时提高效率，发现约10亿参数的模型在效果和计算成本之间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在机器翻译评估中表现优异，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感场景的应用。作者希望探索在保证检测意义改变错误的前提下，模型能做到多小。

Method: 选取多个低于20亿参数的模型，在WMT21、WMT22及SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上进行英德关键错误检测，利用标准化提示词、轻量级logit-bias校准与多数投票机制，并评估语义质量指标和计算指标。

Result: 发现约10亿参数的Gemma-3-1B模型经过权重融合微调后，在SynCED-EnDe-2025上以MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98达到最佳质量-效率平衡，单样本延迟400ms；更大模型Qwen-3-1.7B获得最高MCC，但计算成本较高；超小模型0.6B表现一般且漏检实体与数字错误。

Conclusion: 参数较少且经过指令微调的紧凑型大语言模型，结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，可实现可信赖的本地关键错误检测，适合隐私保护和低成本的机器翻译错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了中英文跨语言语义结构的对齐与差异，揭示了语言迁移过程中结构上的非对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言自然语言处理在低资源语言中应用广泛，但语言结构差异造成迁移困难，尤其是结构复杂的谓词-论元结构。

Method: 通过对中英文平行句子的谓词-论元结构进行注释投射实验，定量和定性分析两种语言间结构偏差及其对迁移性能的影响，并提出结构差异分类。

Result: 实验结果明确显示语言迁移存在非对称性，即以某一语言为源语言时迁移效果不同，说明语言类型差异影响迁移效果。

Conclusion: 跨语言迁移学习中须重视源语言选择问题，语言结构差异对迁移效果有显著影响，未来跨语言NLP研究应深入考察该现象。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练自由的检索门控方法（TARG），通过短暂的无上下文草稿决定是否检索，以提升检索增强生成模型的效率和准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成方法虽提高了事实性，但每次查询都检索会降低质量并增加延迟和计算量。需要一种有效的单次决策机制来权衡检索时机。

Method: 基于基础模型输出的前缀logits，计算不确定性得分（如平均熵、top-1/top-2 logits差距变换或多个随机前缀的小样本方差），超过门限时才触发检索，方法无模型依赖且无额外训练。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG相比于始终检索的RAG显著减少了70-90%的检索次数和整体延迟，同时保持或提升准确率，且开销接近不检索方案。边际信号表现稳定，小样本方差可作为保守策略。

Conclusion: TARG为大语言模型的检索增强提供了一种高效且无需训练的门控方案，有效改善了检索与生成的精度与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种综合方法解决柬埔寨语拼写检查中的多重挑战，结合了子词分割、命名实体识别、字形转语音和语言模型，实现了94.4%的拼写检查准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柬埔寨语拼写检查面临词典与分词模型不匹配、词形多样、松散的复合词以及缺乏命名实体识别模型导致的误判等问题，现有解决方案无法充分应对。

Method: 整合柬埔寨语子词分割、命名实体识别、字形转语音转换和语言模型，识别潜在纠正候选词并进行候选词排序。

Result: 提出的方法在柬埔寨语拼写检查任务中达到94.4%的最高准确率，明显优于已有解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文方法显著提升了柬埔寨语拼写检查的性能，相关基准数据集将公开，有助于后续研究。

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该系统有助于推动终身学习和职业发展，填补高校教学与行业需求之间的差距，促进毕业生就业及专业成长。

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

Result: 微调后的大语言模型结合RAG方法在HotpotQA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在问答任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 设计的基于RAG的大语言模型问答系统有效提升了课程论坛问答质量，缓解了响应延迟和重复提问的问题。

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

TL;DR: 本文提出TermGPT，一种多层次对比微调框架，解决大语言模型在法律和金融领域术语表现不足的问题，提高了术语辨识能力和下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的嵌入空间存在各向同性问题，导致对法律和金融领域专业术语的辨识能力差，影响后续任务的表现。

Method: 构建句子图捕捉语义和结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑信息生成正负样本，设计句子级和词元级多层次对比学习，提升全局语境理解和细粒度术语辨别。

Result: TermGPT在金融和法律领域的术语辨识任务上表现优于现有基线模型，且构建了首个金融术语数据集用于评测。

Conclusion: 通过多层次对比微调，TermGPT有效缓解了大语言模型的各向同性问题，显著提升了专业领域术语的表达能力和相关任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了InTRO框架，通过在token级别进行探索和自我反馈，提升大语言模型的链式推理能力，实现了更准确、简洁的推理结果，并在多个数学推理基准上提升了最高20%的准确率，且具备跨领域迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于单一"黄金"推理路径的监督微调限制了模型的泛化能力，而依赖可验证奖励的增强学习又存在信用分配和计算成本高的问题，亟需一种能在保持准确性的同时提升推理多样性和泛化性的训练方法。

Method: 提出InTRO框架，通过估计生成策略与基于答案条件策略之间的信息差异，计算token级别的重要权重，用于选择下一个token，从而实现token级的探索和自我反馈，逼近难以直接优化的多路径合理推理目标。在单次前向传播中完成推理路径探索和反馈过程，促进简洁准确的链式推理。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，InTRO稳定优于其他方法，相较基础模型最高提升20%的解题准确率，生成的推理链更简洁，冗余度显著降低，同时成功适应跨领域任务，展示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: InTRO有效解决了传统训练方法在推理路径探索和泛化能力上的不足，通过token级的优化策略提升了模型推理的准确性和简洁性，并具备较强的跨领域迁移能力，推动了大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种层次化路由方法HierRouter，动态组合轻量级专用语言模型以提升大语言模型的推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能卓越，但计算和内存资源消耗高，限制了其在资源受限或实时场景中的应用。

Method: 将模型选择问题建模为有限时间马尔可夫决策过程，使用基于PPO的强化学习代理，根据上下文和累积成本动态选择多阶段推理中调用的模型。

Result: 在六个基准测试（包括问答、代码生成和数学推理）中，HierRouter较单模型使用提升响应质量最高达2.4倍，且推理成本仅略有增加。

Conclusion: HierRouter展示了通过层次化路由实现成本效益高且性能优异的大语言模型推理的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

Result: 在三个任务领域和三种不同模型架构上验证，EnchTable在11个数据集上表现出良好的通用性、高实用性和低不安全率，优于六种参数修改方法及两种推理时对齐基线，并在抵御攻破攻击方面优于厂商安全模型。

Conclusion: EnchTable有效解决了微调中安全对齐下降的问题，具备广泛适用性和良好的扩展性，能无缝集成到现有部署流程中，提升模型安全性和实用性，无需大规模重训练。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

Motivation: 社会规范推断复杂且依赖语境和文化背景，现有模型多针对单句或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话中的多轮交互和细腻的规范表达。

Method: 提出Norm-RAG，一种结合语义分块的新型检索增强代理架构，模型融合话语意图、角色、框架和语言线索，基于检索到的结构化规范文档进行多轮多语言对话中的规范推断。并构建多语言真实多轮对话数据集MINDS，标注规范类别及遵守情况。

Conclusion: 结合语义检索和多维话语分析的Norm-RAG有效增强了对复杂社会规范的理解与推断，推动了多语言、多文化背景下的社会智能对话系统发展。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 本研究针对知识组件（KC）自动识别中的冗余标签问题，提出基于语义相似度的合并方法，提升了大规模数据集上的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动识别知识组件耗费大量人力，且现有基于大语言模型的自动化方法在小数据集上效果有限且产生冗余标签，亟需扩展规模并优化冗余问题。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini对646道选择题进行大规模LLM提示生成知识组件，发现标签冗余严重。随后提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并策略，通过调整阈值减少重复标签。

Result: 合并方法将知识组件数量从569减少至428，模型RMSE从0.4285优化至0.4259，显著提升了模型在自动识别任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 单纯依赖大规模LLM生成不足以替代专家设计，但结合语义合并技术可以有效减少标签冗余，推动知识组件自动化识别的实用化。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了REAP方法，通过递归评估和自适应规划解决多跳推理中的局部推理难题，提升了推理准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且未充分利用检索内容和潜在线索，导致推理结果不准确。

Method: 提出REAP方法，包含子任务规划器（SP）和事实提取器（FE）两个模块。SP维持全局视角，动态优化推理路径；FE细粒度分析检索内容，提取可靠答案和线索。两者共同构建逻辑连贯的全球知识表征，提升推理过程的可靠性和可追踪性。同时设计统一任务范式，实现多任务微调，增强复杂数据稀缺任务性能。

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验显示，REAP在内域和外域场景中，显著优于现有RAG方法。

Conclusion: REAP有效解决了多跳推理任务中的局部推理限制，通过全局规划和细粒度信息提取提升了推理的准确性和可靠性，验证了其在复杂多跳推理任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究现有大型语言模型在数字真实性预测任务中的鲁棒性和准确性，揭示其数值推理能力的不足。

Method: 通过控制性扰动测试（如标签翻转探针）对最新模型进行系统评估，考察不同上下文长度及演示示例影响。

Result: 在某些扰动条件下，领先模型准确率下降高达62%，且没有模型在所有条件下表现稳定。增加上下文长度通常降低准确率，但引入扰动的示例后模型表现显著回升。

Conclusion: 数字真实性核查仍是语言模型的关键短板，鲁棒性挑战未被解决，未来需进一步研究提升模型数值推理和鲁棒能力。

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

Motivation: 现有动态检索增强生成模型多基于低置信度触发检索，易导致错误传播后才干预，需更早更精准地确定检索时机。

Method: 提出Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC)方法，利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分检测不确定性趋势，提前触发检索，无需训练，且可无缝集成到解码流程。

Result: 在六个QA基准数据集和三种大型语言模型上，ETC表现优于强基线，减少检索次数，并在领域特定任务中表现出强泛化能力。消融实验和定性分析进一步验证了趋势感知不确定性建模的有效性。

Conclusion: ETC是一种无训练、模型无关且即插即用的动态检索时机判定方法，通过准确捕捉不确定性趋势，提高检索效率和效果，适用于多种场景和语言模型。

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言RAG在面对检索证据与查询语言不一致时，模型生成语言会出现漂移，尤其在推理密集型任务中表现突出，影响结果质量。

Method: 作者开展了系统的实验，发现语言漂移源于解码器级别的崩溃，英文作为主要干扰语言。提出了软约束解码策略（SCD），通过惩罚非目标语言的词元，轻度引导生成语言，且无需训练。

Result: 在三个多语言数据集和多种语言类型上，SCD方法显著提升了生成语言的对齐度和任务性能，且方法通用性强。

Conclusion: SCD为多语言RAG中的语言漂移问题提供了有效且可推广的解决方案，改进了生成文本的语言一致性和任务表现。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为FinNuE的数据集，用于评估自然语言处理中的数值敏感性，发现目前广泛使用的BERTScore在金融文本中对数值变动的识别能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTScore作为一种评价语义相似度的指标，在金融领域对数值变动的敏感性不足，而金融文本中数值的变化直接影响语义含义，这导致现有指标难以准确评估金融文本的语义相似度。

Method: 构建了包含收益电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章中的数值扰动的诊断性数据集FinNuE，利用该数据集系统测试BERTScore对数值变化的识别能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，BERTScore无法区分语义上关键的数值差异，常常对在金融含义上差异显著的文本对给出高相似度评分。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了基于嵌入的相似度指标在金融领域的根本局限性，强调了构建对数值变化敏感的评估框架的必要性，以推动金融自然语言处理的准确评价。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Conclusion: ScaleFormer是一种简单且有效的即插即用框架，可扩展预训练的编码器-解码器模型处理长文本，促进了长上下文推理能力。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供大规模、定量分析MLLMs对音素象征性的可解释性，衔接人工智能与认知语言学领域。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Conclusion: GraphIF有效利用图结构显式建模多轮对话中的关系，显著增强了大语言模型的多轮指令跟随能力，具有良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems.

Method: 通过改编两个现有科学论文数据集，增加多模态验证所需的标注和结构，设计一系列实验测试12个多模态大型语言模型在表格和图表证据上的表现，并辅以人工评估。

Result: 模型在表格证据上的表现优于图表，且较小（8B以下）模型在两种证据格式上的性能相关性较弱，表明跨模态泛化能力有限；人类评价者在两种格式上表现均较强。

Conclusion: 现有多模态大型语言模型在图表理解方面存在明显不足，未来研究应加强模型的图表理解能力，以提升科学结论验证的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究难以直观分析大型语言模型在多轮交互中复杂的推理过程，缺乏合适的可视化工具导致认知负担高。

Method: VISTA基于网页平台，提供上下文影响可视化、对话历史交互修改和自动生成推理依赖树，支持"假设分析"和不同模型对比。

Conclusion: VISTA为多轮推理任务中的LLM推理过程分析提供了统一且交互式的可视化工具，促进了对模型能力和局限性的深入理解。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Text2SQL-Flow，一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的数据增强框架，通过多维度扩充生成大量高质量、结构多样的训练数据SQLFlow，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL数据集规模小、简单且多样性不足，限制了模型性能提升。

Method: Text2SQL-Flow框架跨越六个增强维度，结合SQL执行验证、自然语言生成、推理链跟踪及数据分类，利用模块化数据库管理实现跨库扩展，构建大规模高质量数据集SQLFlow。

Result: 在开放源代码大模型中微调SQLFlow提升了基准性能；对于闭源大模型，提出了基于结构对齐的检索方法，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 基于高质量结构化数据的可扩展数据增强方法对提升Text-to-SQL系统性能具有关键作用，为该领域提供了数据驱动的新范式。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出EffiReason-Bench，一个统一的基准测试平台，用于评估大语言模型在连锁推理中的效率方法，通过构建标准化注释和新指标，实现跨范式的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型使用连锁推理提示虽有良好推理性能，但产生过长解释导致成本增加和准确率下降，且不同效率优化方法的评测缺乏统一标准。

Method: 设计EffiReason-Bench基准，涵盖三类效率方法（推理蓝图、动态执行、后期优化），构建CommonsenseQA和LogiQA的标准化连锁推理注释，并设计经济折中启发的E3-Score指标用于稳定评价。

Result: 在6种开源大语言模型和4个数学、常识及逻辑任务数据集上评估7种方法，发现无单一方法普适优越，最佳策略依赖模型规模、任务难度及架构。

Conclusion: 提出的统一基准和评价指标促进了高效推理方法的公正比较和发展，不同方法适用于不同场景和模型规模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的人格感知对齐框架（PAL），通过两阶段训练和选择生成策略实现个性化对话生成，提升了对人格信息的敏感性和生成的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化对话生成方法通常通过基于token的语言模型隐式实现个性化，容易忽视给定的人格信息，生成泛化回复。为了增强模型对人格的关注，提高生成回复的个性化和一致性，本文提出了新的训练目标和方法。

Method: 本文设计了人格感知对齐框架（PAL），采用两阶段训练：人格感知学习和人格对齐，结合简单易用的推理策略“先选择再生成”，以实现语义层面的人格信息对齐和个性化生成。

Result: 通过大量实验，PAL框架在个性化对话任务上优于多种先进个性化对话模型及大型语言模型，表现出更强的人格相关性和敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出的PAL框架有效解决了传统方法忽视人格信息的问题，显著提升了对话生成的人格一致性和相关性，具有较大应用潜力。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语种训练数据选择方法忽略了多语种数据的语言结构特性，导致多语种能力受限且对数据选择敏感。

Method: 提出两阶段的LangGPS框架，先根据语言可分离性指标筛选数据，再结合现有选择方法精炼训练样本。

Result: 在六个基准和22种语言上的实验显示，LangGPS能提升现有数据选择方法的效果和泛化能力，尤其对理解任务和低资源语言表现突出。

Conclusion: 语言可分离性不仅利于形成清晰语言边界并加速适应，还能作为多语种课程学习的有效信号，促进更具语言学信息的模型训练。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端语音语言模型存在较大响应延迟，主要因自回归生成方式及复杂流匹配模型导致。

Method: 提出VocalNet-M2，结合多码本标记器和多标记预测策略，直接生成多码本语音标记，取消延迟高的流匹配模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，VocalNet-M2将首块延迟由约725ms降至350ms，同时性能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VocalNet-M2有效提升语音语言模型实时交互的响应速度与性能，单码本与多码本策略对比为高效模型设计提供依据。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Motivation: 现有基准多关注单轮交互，忽视了多轮对话复杂性及模型关键能力评估，且存在对话边界模糊和上下文不一致等挑战。

Method: 设计MTR-DuplexBench，将连续全双工对话切分为离散轮次，实现逐轮评估模型的多维能力，包括对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性。

Result: 实验表明现有全双工模型在多轮和多维度评估中表现不稳定，存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的MTR-DuplexBench有效补充了现有评测体系，为全面评价全双工语音语言模型提供了必要工具。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

*Shuyi Liu,Yuming Shang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TruthfulRAG框架，利用知识图谱解决检索增强生成系统中的事实冲突，提升了大语言模型回复的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着外部知识库扩展和模型内参知识过时，RAG系统面临检索信息与模型内知识冲突的问题，现有方法在解决事实冲突时理解不全面。

Method: TruthfulRAG通过从检索内容中提取三元组构建知识图谱，采用基于查询的图检索和基于熵的过滤机制，精准定位并缓解知识冲突。

Result: 大量实验证明 TruthfulRAG优于现有方法，有效缓解了知识冲突，提升了系统的鲁棒性和可信度。

Conclusion: 利用知识图谱进行事实级冲突解决是提升RAG系统生成内容准确性和可靠性的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

### [44] [Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381)
*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文指出当前对基础大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的评估存在方法论上的根本性缺陷，主要因基础LLMs的预训练目标与推理的规范标准（如正确性）不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过评估基础LLMs探究其推理能力，但忽视了基础LLMs的预训练目标与评价推理的标准之间存在根本性的错位。

Method: 通过理论分析说明基础LLMs生成逻辑有效或无效结论主要是语言模式的统计结果，而非对正确答案的真实推理尝试。

Result: 揭示了两点：一是基础LLMs的输出不应被视为真正的正确推理尝试；二是基于基础LLMs的推理结论难以推广到通过后续训练优化的指令跟随模型。

Conclusion: 呼吁对现有基于上述假设的研究进行批判性重新审视，未来研究应考虑这些方法论陷阱，以合理评估LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DELICATE，一种结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息的新型神经符号实体链接方法，以及一个多领域的历史意大利语EL语料库ENEIDE，显著提升了历史意大利语的实体链接表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂的文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型及知识库中长尾实体的存在，历史领域的实体链接任务依然充满挑战。

Method: 提出DELICATE方法，结合BERT编码器与Wikidata的上下文信息，通过时间合理性和实体类型一致性选择合适的知识库实体；同时构建了多领域的历史意大利语EL语料库ENEIDE。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务上优于大型模型，且其置信度分数和特征敏感度分析使结果更具可解释性。

Conclusion: DELICATE有效解决了历史意大利语实体链接中的难题，提升了性能及结果的可解释性，ENEIDE语料库为该领域提供了 valuable资源。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于类比范式结构的轻量语言模型训练方法，显著减少训练数据量，实现接近大型模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖海量数据训练，探索是否通过类比范式组织使轻量模型在极少数据下达到相似性能。

Method: 结合类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索，训练轻量模型（BERT+CNN，0.5M参数）完成英语因果/入式交替结构的句子填空任务。

Result: 仅用100个结构化样本训练，轻量模型达到F1=0.95，优于零次GPT-3的F1=0.87。消融实验和跨现象验证显示方法稳健且优于随机基线。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织使轻量模型在语法规则学习上可用极少数据实现竞争性能，展示了高效语言学习的新途径。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 该论文针对大语言模型对模糊请求易产生单一理解的问题，提出生成多重解释-回答对的结构化响应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型面对模糊请求时往往只能给出单一解释，导致意图误解、用户挫败及安全风险。

Method: 采用强化学习训练模型，设计定制奖励函数，以多个有效答案作为监督，生成包含多重解释与答案的结构化回复。

Result: 在会话问答和语义解析任务中，该方法比基线覆盖更多有效答案；人类评价显示解释与答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成多重明确解释，提升了模型的透明度与效率，并支持下游应用的结构化输出需求。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

TL;DR: 本文通过设计基于三个明确状态跟踪任务的基准测试，评估了大型语言模型（如GPT-4和Llama3）在状态跟踪任务中的表现，发现新一代模型具有较好的状态跟踪能力，旧一代模型表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了研究大型语言模型在状态跟踪任务中的具体表现，剥离其他因素的影响，理解其在复杂推理中的能力。

Method: 提出一个包含三个明确状态跟踪任务的基准，并在不同场景下测试并分析不同代际的LLMs表现，重点考察如链式思考（Chain of Thought）等机制的影响。

Result: 结果显示，最新一代的LLMs（GPT-4和Llama3）在集成链式思考机制后，在状态跟踪任务上表现出色；而旧一代模型虽然初期能理解任务，但随着步骤增加，表现明显下降。

Conclusion: 新一代大型语言模型具备较强的状态跟踪能力，特别是结合链式思考机制时，旧模型在任务持续推进过程中存在明显劣势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

*Zihan Gao,Yifei Xu,Jacob Thebault-Spieker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LocalBench，这是首个系统评估大语言模型（LLMs）在美国县级地方知识上的基准测试，涵盖约14782对问答，结果显示当前模型在地方知识推理上的表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型主要评估宏观地理任务，缺乏对超本地化知识的理解与评估，而现实应用越来越需要AI能够处理社区特有的动态和文化叙事。

Method: 设计LocalBench基准，包含526个县、49个州的多维度地方知识问答，数据来源包括人口普查、地方论坛及地区新闻，并在13款主流大模型上进行闭卷和网络辅助测试。

Result: 最佳模型在叙事类问题上准确率仅56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%，且模型规模增大和网络辅助并不总能提升性能，甚至在部分模型上有负面影响。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在处理细粒度地方知识方面能力有限，亟需开发能够理解和适应不同社区地理文化细节的公平且具地方意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识提供的提示优化方法（KPPO），通过知识填补、批量评估和知识剪枝，提升了模型在知识密集型任务中的表现，同时减少了令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法主要依赖于激活模型潜能的策略，难以满足知识密集领域对事实知识、术语精确和推理模式的需求。

Method: KPPO框架将提示优化视为系统性知识整合，包含知识缺口填补机制、批量候选评估方法和自适应知识剪枝策略。

Result: 在15个跨领域知识密集型基准测试上，KPPO相比最强基线平均提升约6%的性能，且令牌消耗持平或更低，最高减少29%。

Conclusion: KPPO通过系统性知识集成有效克服了传统激发式方法的局限，在知识密集型任务中表现更优且更高效。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在复杂、多轮及系统提示的指令执行能力方面仍存在显著挑战，且缺乏高质量的人类标注基准和可靠的奖励信号，阻碍了有效训练和评估。

Method: 引入了包含1600多个提示和专家设计评分准则的AdvancedIF基准；设计了基于评分准则生成、细调的评分验证器及奖励塑形的RIFL训练管线，实现指令执行能力的强化学习。

Result: RIFL方法使模型在AdvancedIF基准上绝对提升6.7%，并在公开基准上表现优异。消融实验验证了各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 评分准则作为训练和评估工具，能够显著提升复杂指令执行能力，为构建更强大可靠的AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究语言风格如恐惧或好奇如何作为攻击手段，使大语言模型产生不安全响应。通过构建11种语言风格的风格增强绕过测试集，发现风格重构能显著提升绕过率。提出的风格中和预处理步骤有效降低绕过成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗测试多关注语义等效的绕过提示，较少关注语言风格变化作为攻击面，本文旨在揭示语言风格对模型安全性的影响。

Method: 构建风格增强绕过测试集，将三种标准数据集中的提示转换为11种语言风格，使用手工模板和基于LLM的重写方法；评估16个主流模型的绕过成功率；提出风格中和预处理步骤以剥离操纵性风格线索。

Result: 风格重构最高提升绕过成功率57个百分点，恐惧、好奇和同情风格最有效，基于上下文的重写优于模板；风格中和预处理显著降低绕过成功率。

Conclusion: 语言风格是大语言模型安全防护中的一个系统性且难以缩放的脆弱性，需引起更多关注，并通过风格中和等方法进行缓解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有会话记忆评估框架在统计能力、数据生成一致性和评估灵活性方面存在局限，亟需一个综合且实用的评估基准来推动领域发展。

Method: 构建包含75,336个问答对的评估基准，覆盖用户事实、助手回忆、偏好等多样类别；分析会话记忆系统的独特增长特性，比较全上下文方法与RAG系统（如Mem0）的性能表现，并研究不同交互轮数下的适用策略。

Result: 全上下文方法在前30轮会话中表现优异（准确率70-82%）；但当会话历史超过150轮时，RAG方法因成本和延迟优势更明显；Mem0在150轮以内表现不佳（30-45%准确率）。

Conclusion: 会话记忆因其可进行详尽搜索和重新排序的“小语料”优势，应得到专门研究，而非简单套用通用RAG方法。研究揭示了不同会话长度下优化策略的切换点。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Motivation: 探讨体裁作为形式划分与制度划分的合理性，以及作者性别如何影响文学分类。

Method: 基于Andrew Piper的CONLIT数据集，利用Welch的ANOVA分析不同体裁与性别间叙事特征分布，用逻辑回归建模文学分类与性别调节效应，并分析风格和语义向量。

Result: 发现了文学类别中具有统计学显著的形式标记，且女性作者使文学地位的界限变得更模糊。

Conclusion: 体裁在文学分类中具有可靠的形式标识，女性创作者对文学和体裁小说的边界造成影响，削弱了传统文学地位的明显界限。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在长文档理解中面临信息干扰和计算复杂度高的双重挑战。现有方法在细节保留和系统复杂性之间难以权衡，迫切需要一种有效整合检索与生成的方案。

Method: 分析发现MLLMs具有粗到细的推理模式，早期层广泛关注内容，后期层聚焦证据页。基于此，设计URaG架构，通过轻量级跨模态检索模块将早期层转为证据选择器，筛选相关页面供后续层精细处理。

Result: 实验证明URaG在准确率上达到最新水平，同时减少了44-56%的计算负担，效益显著。

Conclusion: URaG有效结合了检索与生成过程，使多模态大语言模型能够高效理解长文档，为未来相关研究和应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

TL;DR: 本文针对医生-患者对话中的医疗订单准确提取问题，评估了MedGemma语言模型及三种提示方法，发现简单的one-shot提示表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻临床文档负担并保障患者安全，迫切需要准确自动提取医疗订单。

Method: 采用MedGemma领域专用开源语言模型，系统比较了one-shot、ReAct和多步代理工作流三种提示策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管复杂提示方法强大，但简单的one-shot方法在官方验证集上表现最好，复杂推理链反而带来“过度思考”噪声。

Conclusion: 直接简单的提示策略在手工标注对话中更稳健高效，本文为临床信息提取提示策略选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Method: 提出了基于挖掘提示的少样本学习策略（通过检索相似训练样本），以及基于元数据属性预测的生成调整方法，动态优化响应输出。

Result: 实验证明，挖掘提示策略提升了响应的相关性，元数据引导的生成方法进一步提高了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 结合两种方法，展示了利用AI提升远程伤口护理问答可靠性和效率的有效方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

Motivation: 现有因果语言模型虽为最优语言压缩算法，但在计算上难以精确估计语言熵，限制了模型性能和泛化能力提升。

Method: 引入编码器增强的因果解码器架构，提升训练效率和压缩率，基于模型输出实现每个token的熵估计，并分析熵估计与模型泛化之间的关系。

Result: 新架构在有限硬件上训练效率更高，压缩性能优于传统因果transformer，且基于熵估计训练的模型表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 精确估计并控制模型训练中的语言熵能够提升语言模型的泛化能力，提出的编码器增强因果解码器是实现这一目标的有效方案。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时框架依赖粗略的自我验证和自我修正，效果有限，无法有效处理复杂任务中的推理。

Method: SSR将模型回答分解为可验证的子问题和子答案对，通过受控的重新求解和自洽性检查估计每一步信心，定位不可靠步骤并迭代细化。

Result: 在五个推理基准和三个大型语言模型中，SSR持续优于当前最先进的迭代自我优化方法，表现出更高准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: SSR不仅提升了推理性能，还提供了一种原则性黑盒方式评估和理解大型语言模型的内部推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences.

We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为生成对抗蒸馏（GAD）的方法，实现了黑盒和在线策略的语言模型蒸馏。通过生成者-判别者的对抗训练，学生模型表现优于传统序列级知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的黑盒蒸馏仅通过教师模型的文本输出进行训练，缺乏对模型内部信息的利用，且现有方法的效果有限，亟需一种更稳定且高效的蒸馏方法。

Method: 将学生模型视为生成器，训练一个判别器区分学生和教师的输出，形成一个最小最大化的对抗游戏，判别器作为在线的奖励模型，为学生提供动态反馈。

Result: GAD方法在实验中表现优于序列级知识蒸馏，训练出的Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评测中其表现接近教师模型GPT-5-Chat。

Conclusion: GAD是一种有效且有前景的黑盒大语言模型蒸馏范式，能够提升学生模型性能，实现高质量的知识传递。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型的权重后训练量化方法ParoQuant，通过使用成对旋转量化和通道尺度缩放，有效抑制量化误差，提升推理任务的准确率，同时保持较低的推理开销。

Motivation: 现有的权重后训练量化方法由于权重和激活中的离群值，导致量化误差大、准确率下降，特别是在需要长链思维的推理型大型语言模型中错误累积严重，现有方法不能有效抑制离群值或推理时开销大。

Method: 提出ParoQuant方法，结合硬件友好且可优化的独立Givens旋转与通道尺度缩放，将量化组内动态范围缩小，均衡通道幅值，同时共设计推理内核，充分利用GPU并行，保持旋转和缩放在推理时轻量化。

Result: ParoQuant在推理任务中相比AWQ平均提升2.4%的准确率，且推理开销低于10%。

Conclusion: ParoQuant有效提升了推理型大型语言模型的量化精度和效率，推动了其更高效准确的应用部署。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Large transformer models, trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated impressive few-shot performance on previously unseen tasks without requiring parameter updates. This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rise of agentic systems that combine orchestration, tool use, and conversational capabilities, has been more visible by the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). While open-domain frameworks exist, applying them in private domains remains difficult due to heterogeneous tool formats, domain-specific jargon, restricted accessibility of APIs, and complex governance. Conventional solutions, such as fine-tuning on synthetic dialogue data, are burdensome and brittle under domain shifts, and risk degrading general performance. In this light, we introduce a framework for private-domain multi-agent conversational systems that avoids training and data generation by adopting behavior modeling and documentation. Our design simply assumes an orchestrator, a tool-calling agent, and a general chat agent, with tool integration defined through structured specifications and domain-informed instructions. This approach enables scalable adaptation to private tools and evolving contexts without continual retraining. The framework supports practical use cases, including lightweight deployment of multi-agent systems, leveraging API specifications as retrieval resources, and generating synthetic dialogue for evaluation -- providing a sustainable method for aligning agent behavior with domain expertise in private conversational ecosystems.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

Motivation: 现代软件开发需要代码质量高且易维护，多智能体大语言模型的协作流程对代码质量及正确性影响尚不明朗。

Method: 采用三个大语言模型模拟瀑布式的需求、设计、实现、测试四阶段，评估100个Python任务，分析多智能体工作流程对代码生成性能的影响。

Result: 瀑布式流程使代码更清晰易维护，但通常降低功能正确性，测试阶段改进验证覆盖同时带来推理失败，需求和设计阶段影响较小。

Conclusion: 软件过程结构根本影响大语言模型的推理与协作方式，存在结构严谨性与灵活性之间的权衡，提示多智能体代码生成的设计需平衡流程和创新性。

Abstract: Modern software systems require code that is not only functional but also maintainable and well-structured. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI agents across domains has made systematic evaluation crucial for ensuring their usefulness and successful production deployment. Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements.

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.

Abstract: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools, while invaluable for identifying potential coding problems, functional bugs, or vulnerabilities, often generate an overwhelming number of warnings, many of which are non-actionable. This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports. To facilitate follow-up research in this domain, we make both the dataset and the tools used to generate it publicly available.

Abstract: This work focuses on effectively generating diverse solutions for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) formulas, targeting the theories of bit-vectors, arrays, and uninterpreted functions, which is a critical task in software and hardware testing. Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\% to 76.4\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency. PanSampler advances SMT sampling, reducing the cost of software testing and hardware verification.
