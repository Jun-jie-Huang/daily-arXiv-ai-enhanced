The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively.

Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%. This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles. WOLF moves deception evaluation beyond static datasets, offering a dynamic, controlled testbed for measuring deceptive and detective capacity in adversarial multi-agent interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOLF\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u72fc\u4eba\u6740\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b3a\u9a97\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6b3a\u9a97\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6b3a\u9a97\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u540c\u4faa\u6b3a\u9a97\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u65b9\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "WOLF\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u6e38\u620f\u72fc\u4eba\u6740\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cLangGraph\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u663c\u591c\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u8f6e\u6b21\u53ca\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bb0\u5f55\u53d1\u8a00\u5185\u5bb9\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6b3a\u9a97\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57287330\u6761\u53d1\u8a00\u548c100\u8f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u72fc\u4eba\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8631%\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u53d1\u8a00\uff0c\u540c\u4faa\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe71-73%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea652%\u3002\u968f\u7740\u56de\u5408\u63a8\u8fdb\uff0c\u5bf9\u72fc\u4eba\u7684\u6000\u7591\u4ece52%\u5347\u81f360%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6751\u6c11\u548c\u533b\u751f\u7684\u6000\u7591\u7ef4\u6301\u572844-46%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5ef6\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u9a97\u5b50\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e14\u672a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u8bda\u5b9e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "conclusion": "WOLF\u57fa\u51c6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4e0e\u4fa6\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5ef6\u957f\u4e92\u52a8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fa6\u6d4b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence.

Accepted to AGENT 2026 (ICSE 2026 workshop)", "summary": "Context. LLM-based autonomous agents in software engineering rely on large, proprietary models, limiting local deployment. This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.\n  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.\n  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.\n  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.\n  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6d6a\u8d39\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u6548\u4e0a\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8865\u507fSLM\u7f3a\u70b9\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u4e13\u6709\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u6cbb\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63a7\u5236\u8bc4\u4ef7\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u6846\u67b6\uff08SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover\uff09\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c150\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u65f6\u957f\u3001Token\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cAutoCodeRover\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u6846\u67b6OpenHands\u9ad89.4\u500d\u3002\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5927\u91cf\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u5728\u65e0\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002SLM\u7684\u6709\u9650\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u7f16\u6392\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528SLM\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002"}}

However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision.

This work confronts this challenge by introducing a targeted RL framework designed to mitigate both intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations across short and long-form question answering. We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme. To further bolster reliability, our framework explicitly rewards the model for refusing to answer unanswerable questions, thereby cultivating crucial cautiousness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methodology yields significant performance gains across a diverse suite of benchmarks, substantially reducing both hallucination types.

Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5fae\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u53d6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5171\u8bc6\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6548\u7387\u548c\u534f\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u52a0\u5feb\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5fae\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).\n  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).\n  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters. The model proved more stable in the Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions, while presenting limitations in the integration of internal states and external contexts.

Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7ba1\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u7531\u6587\u6863\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4fbf\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u9700\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\uff08OML\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u6784\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u6784\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b80\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u52a8\u529b\u4f20\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7248\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u8bbf\u95ee\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u914d\u5957\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6267\u884c\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed \"lexical-dense\" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification.

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5LogICL\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u65e5\u5fd7\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u589e\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5927\u8fb9\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u62ecICL\u5f15\u5bfc\u9879\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u68c0\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLogICL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1LogICL\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "LogICL\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u793a\u4f8b\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system.

We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \\emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance.

However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1.

Khajavi", "Guangkai Jiang", "Xinru Liu"], "title": "Targeting Misalignment: A Conflict-Aware Framework for Reward-Model-based LLM Alignment", "comment": null, "summary": "Reward-model-based fine-tuning is a central paradigm in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences. However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6307\u6807(PACS\u548cKendall-Tau\u8ddd\u79bb)\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7b97\u6cd5(SHF-CAS)\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51b2\u7a81\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate.

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6216\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u3001\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u75ab\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014TCA-Attention\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff09\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u52a0\u901f\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cTCA-Attention\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.8\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1161%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "TCA-Attention\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b58\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u975e\u767d\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56f0\u96be\u5b66\u751f\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8005\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3016\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b50\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf/\u65cf\u88d4\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6b3e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5904\u4e8e\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u975e\u767d\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u88ab\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56f0\u96be\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6570\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf/\u65cf\u88d4\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5904\u4e8e\u52a3\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6709\u8bef\u5224\u503e\u5411\u3002\u6bd4\u65b9\u8bf4\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u975e\u767d\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56f0\u96be\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u5219\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u88ab\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u8005\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "CONCUR\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\u5339\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540cAI\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u8bad\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\u8def\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CONCUR\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cCONCUR\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "CONCUR\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\u5339\u914d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking. Large LLMs produce high-quality drafts with minimal hierarchical performance loss; smaller models require hierarchical setups for long judgments. Initial benchmarks show varying model performance, with human-drafted releases ranking highest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528CourtPressGER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5fb7\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53f8\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u805a\u7126\u6280\u672f\u6027\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9762\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53f8\u6cd5\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u53ca\u516c\u4f17\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u540d\u4e3aCourtPressGER\u76846.4\u5343\u6761\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u88c1\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6bd4\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001LLM\u88c1\u5224\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6392\u540d\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u8349\u7a3f\u65f6\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5c42\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5904\u7406\u957f\u88c1\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u8d28\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6613\u8bfb\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u9700\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6301\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u3002"}}

To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning. Overall, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models in semantic coverage and reasoning transparency, and demonstrates strong practical value in complex financial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6761\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5f97\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u6574\u5408\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall. The findings demonstrate that proper model configuration has a significant effect on performance and reveal the adaptability and stability of the model under different conditions.

We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs. However, certain risks still persist: LLM-SEs do not outperform TSEs in credibility, political neutrality and safety metrics.

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fe\u6587\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6587\u6df7\u5408RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\\model{}\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4f55\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5957\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eprompt\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u786e\u8ba4\u6027\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u67e5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u914d\u7f6e\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7814\u7a76\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9002\u5f53\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u79d1\u5b66\u3002"}}

First, context-aware prompts are designed to guide LLMs in extracting implicit hate patterns. Next, task-specific features are integrated during supervised fine-tuning to enhance domain adaptation.

Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories.

Revisiting LLM Reliability in Hate Speech Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\u03ba$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u867d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7ee9\u6548\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\u5c1a\u5b58\u7591\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027(xRR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u540d\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \\emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error. Guided by this analysis, we introduce a time-scheduled self-distillation loss during training that enhances prediction confidence in later training stages, thereby enabling more accurate probability estimation and improved convergence. Experiments show that \\emph{d}-TreeRPO outperforms existing baselines and achieves significant gains on multiple reasoning benchmarks, including +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500. Ablation studies and computational cost analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c97\u7cd9\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684d-TreeRPO\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c97\u7cd9\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ffd\u89c6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u504f\u671f\u671b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86d-TreeRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u4f18\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6761\u4ef6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "d-TreeRPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u72ec+86.2\u3001Countdown+51.6\u3001GSM8K+4.5\u548cMath500+5.3\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "d-TreeRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728dLLMs\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do.

Besides, to address the issues of model output diversity and quality, we have also employed thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8B model to match or even outperform strong baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude across numerous dimensions. This demonstrates the great potential of MOA in building RPAs that can simultaneously meet the demands of role knowledge, persona style, diverse scenarios, and complex multi-turn conversations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4ee3\u7406\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u9879\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4ee3\u7406\uff08RPAs\uff09\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u638c\u63e1\u591a\u79cd\u51b2\u7a81\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u90fd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u8131\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6MOA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86GPT-4o\u548cClaude\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "MOA\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States.

This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners.

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ChronusOmni\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u89c6\u542c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9690\u5f0f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5355\u5143\u63d2\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u4ea4\u53c9\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u7279\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ChronusAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ChronusOmni\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728ChronusAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc730%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ChronusOmni\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u542c\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.

This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684NMT\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u95e8\u63a7\u4ea4\u4e92\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65e0\u95e8\u63a7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9886\u57df\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08NMT\uff09\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NMT\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}
