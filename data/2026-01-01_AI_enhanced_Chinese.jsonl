In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization.

We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare.

This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults.

We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines.

A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b67\u89c6\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5HyFair\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6216\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\uff08SMT\u548cMILP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff09\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5f62\u6210HyFair\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u8fdd\u4f8b\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "HyFair\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b67\u89c6\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \\textsc{CAT} are the \\emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \\emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \\emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \\textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5173\u7cfb(CAR)\u66f2\u7ebf\u548cCORE\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9009\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCAT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CAT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\u66f2\u7ebf\u548cCORE\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7ec6\u817b\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6c7d\u8f66\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5177\u4f53\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u5411\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0(SLR)\u7ed3\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PRISMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6807\u51c6\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u5316\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027AI\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d2f\u7a7f\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c7d\u8f66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes.

Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u589e\u957f\u8fc5\u901f\u4f46\u504f\u91cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u540e\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u8003\u8651\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u5de5\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf995\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u91cd\u70b9\u53ca\u5de5\u4e1a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8695\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u7126\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u540e\u671f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u504f\u89c1\u6839\u6e90\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u8f6c\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e94\u8d2f\u7a7f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u672f\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\\% on the development set and 71.6\\% on the blind test set.

Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u4e0d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679091\u7ec4\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u6784\u5efa\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0e15\u4f4d\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u91ce\u8f74\uff0c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u8f74\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCAB\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u968f\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\uff08CAB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u548cCAB\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u534f\u4f5c\u578bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eba\u672c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u5fc3\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts.

Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction.

Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools.

However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9690\u853d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f46\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5229\u5f0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u660e\u663e\u5371\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u6666\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u63a9\u76d6\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9690\u853d\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6HarmTransform\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u590d\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "HarmTransform\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9690\u853d\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fa9\u8bba\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u8bdd\u9898\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bdd\u9898\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction.

Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoHalLo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u9488\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5c04\u5230\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u636e\u6b64\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoHalLo\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u51fa\u5e7b\u89c9\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5305\u542b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u5148\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u6cd5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u9488\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5c04\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\u5143\u7ec4\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08P-AST\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08O-AST\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cCoHalLo\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CoHalLo\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \\textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model.

For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.\n  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.\n  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.\n  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance.

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUnifico\u591aISA\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5806\u6808\u5e03\u5c40\u907f\u514d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784ISA\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784ISA\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5e94\u7f16\u8bd1\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u591aISA\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668Unifico\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5806\u6808\u5e03\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00ABI\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLVM\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301x86-64\u548cARMv8\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Unifico\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u591aISA\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784ISA\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u8f6f\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002Unifico\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5806\u6808\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00\u7684ABI\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5730\u5740\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eLLVM\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301x86-64\u548cARMv8\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5f00\u9500\u4e0d\u52306%\uff0c\u4f4e\u7aef\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc710%\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709Popcorn\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0cUnifico\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u5927\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\uff08\u7ea6200%\u964d\u81f310%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Unifico\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784ISA\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5806\u6808\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6267\u884c\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784ISA\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD.

However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u9700\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u4fee\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u65f6\u504f\u79bb\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6700\u5c0f\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u767d\u76d2\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u6280\u672f\uff09\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u53cd\u601d\u53ca\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u9700\u7f16\u8f91\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea60.2\u7684\u4f4e\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548cBrier\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u504f\u5dee\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness.

This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Preguss\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u867d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8de8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u65ad\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "Preguss\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u8de8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "Preguss\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u81ea\u7531\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8680.6%~88.9%\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5343\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Preguss\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d85\u8fc7\u5343\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u81ea\u7531\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57df\u9002\u5e94RoBERTa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u867d\u7136\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5931\u6548\u539f\u56e0\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRoBERTa\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08\u5047\u9633\u6027\u51cf\u5c1163%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bdd\u8bed\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A BERTopic-Based Analysis of Pull Requests", "comment": null, "summary": "LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories.

We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error.

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DynaFix\u5229\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "DynaFix\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5982\u53d8\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8c03\u7528\u6808\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u540e\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u7684\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Defects4J v1.2\u548cv2.0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDynaFix\u4fee\u590d\u4e86186\u4e2a\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec38\u4e2a\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u591a35\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u8865\u4e01\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1170%\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaFix\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u590d\u6742\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

A Pull Request-Based Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts.

Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08RAG\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u9898\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528SecBERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8fc7FinQA\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc77%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f46\u4ecd\u672a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u65b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6743\u8861\u5e7b\u89c9\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u76ca\u3002"}}

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence.

We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u4e60\u60ef\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u7b54\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7b54\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u4e60\u60ef\u5f80\u5f80\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u5386\u53f2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u5386\u53f2\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08AUC\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f30.815\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u504f\u5dee\u540e\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5ba1\u89c6\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets.

Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making.

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access.

Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRISE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u2018\u6b65\u9aa4\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b65\u9aa4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u89e3\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "RISE\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u601d\u3001\u56de\u6eaf\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u53ca\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6RISE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u3002"}}

This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\\% accuracy and 93.90\\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faWISE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u516b\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e\u8bbd\u523a\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e\u8bbd\u523a\u65b0\u95fb\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91cd\u53e0\u4f46\u610f\u56fe\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0820,000\u6761\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528WISE\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c425\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u3001ROC-AUC\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6210\u5bf9t\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001McNemar\u68c0\u9a8c\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "MiniLM\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0887.58%\uff09\uff0cRoBERTa-base\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8ROC-AUC\uff0895.42%\uff09\uff0cDistilBERT\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0886.28%\uff09\u548cROC-AUC\uff0893.90%\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5982MiniLM\u548cDistilBERT\u5728\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e\u8bbd\u523a\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u533a\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/AgenticFinLab/latent-planning", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "iCLP\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiCLP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0ciCLP\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "iCLP\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u9690\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models.

As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions.

This technical report mainly presents the underlying training infrastructure that enables reliable and efficient scaling to frontier model sizes. We detail systematic methodologies for operator-level and end-to-end numerical accuracy verification, ensuring consistency across hardware platforms and distributed parallelism strategies. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of performance optimizations, including interleaved pipeline scheduling, attention-aware data scheduling for long-sequence training,hierarchical and overlapped communication for expert parallelism, and DVM-based operator fusion.

However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MedKGI\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u95ee\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u591a\u4f59\u65e0\u6548\u63d0\u95ee\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u5224\u522b\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528OSCE\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aMedKGI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5148\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea630%\u3002", "conclusion": "MedKGI\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u63d0\u95ee\u6548\u7387\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u574730%\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts.

FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines.

While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.\n  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios.

Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684WM-SAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8bbd\u523a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8981\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6355\u6349\u8bdd\u8bed\u8868\u5c42\u542b\u4e49\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faWM-SAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u9884\u671f\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u4e13\u95e8\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u8bbd\u523a\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "WM-SAR\u5728\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cWM-SAR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u6587\u6863\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u65ad\uff08NLI\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u957f\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5c42\u6b21Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u6587\u6863\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7528NLI\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u4f7f\u63a9\u7801\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fdc\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb\u91cd\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u957f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00mT5\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0cLLM\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u6545\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684LLMs\u3001\u5927\u578b\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6458\u8981\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u578b\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5230\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982mT5\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\u518d\u6458\u8981\u53ca\u56de\u8bd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684LLMs\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00mT5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u8f83\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982mT5\uff09\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLMs\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.\n  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u96c5\u601d\u5199\u4f5c\u5907\u8003\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u7ee9\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u6df1\u5316\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c5\u601d\u5199\u4f5c\u5907\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7b26\u5408\u96c5\u601d\u5199\u4f5c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u53cd\u9988\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76(DBR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eDistilBERT\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5e26\u56de\u5f52\u5934\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eDistilBERT\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027(MAE=0.66\uff0c$R^2$\u4e3a\u6b63)\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\u5e2e\u52a9\u8003\u751f\u4ea7\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u5347(\u5e73\u5747+0.060\u5206\uff0cp=0.011)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u529f\u80fd\u9002\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u5de5\u6559\u5b66\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u8868\u5c42\u4fee\u6539\u6bd4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5206\u4f5c\u6587\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u957f\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u5b98\u65b9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks.

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-5.1\u3001Gemini 3 Pro\u548cClaude 4.5 Opus\u4e09\u6b3e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0e\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u65f6\u6001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5f3a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u96f6\u6b21\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5168\u7403\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u76f2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\u5bf9\u6297\u6570\u636e\u96c6HausaSafety\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u975e\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u75282x4\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u57281440\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8003\u5bdf\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u82f1\u8bedvs\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\uff09\u4e0e\u65f6\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u65f6\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff0c\u8c6a\u8428\u8bed\u4e0bClaude 4.5 Opus\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u6001\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u9632\u5fa1\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u6001\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u4fdd\u5b88\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u8fbe\u52309.2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u65f6\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6ce2\u52a8\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u201c\u76f2\u70b9\u201d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\u7528\u6237\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53d8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u65f6\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8f7b\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CREST\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u5e38\u5e38\u4f4e\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5982\u6d45\u5c42\u601d\u8003\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cd\u590d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u5bfb\u627e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u79bb\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba4\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u5411\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65cb\u8f6c\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6cbf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCREST\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5982\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u56de\u6eaf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u90e8\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65cb\u8f6c\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\uff0cCREST\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6d45\u5c42\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCREST\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe17.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1137.6%\u7684\u751f\u6210token\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "CREST\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Youtu-LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fbe\u5230\u9876\u5c16\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u8f7b\u91cf\u53c8\u5177\u5185\u751f\u4ee3\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86Youtu-LLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MLA\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u8fbe128k\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u638c\u63e1\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u590d\u6742STEM\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e2d\u671f\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f3a\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "Youtu-LLM\u5728\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u7c7b\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Youtu-LLM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u517c\u987e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Barkan", "Sid Black", "Oliver Sourbut"], "title": "Do Large Language Models Know What They Are Capable Of?", "comment": "23 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities.

Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Debater\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4fee\u8f9e\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8fa9\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u8fa9\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8fa9\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u53d1\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6709\u636e\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u8fa9\u8bba\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fa9\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u89c2\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u8bba\u636e\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0cR-Debater\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u5148\u524d\u8bba\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u6761\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8fa9\u8bba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u53d1\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eInspireScore\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eDebatrix\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u8f6e\u8fa9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316ORCHID\u8fa9\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cR-Debater\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u548c\u5355\u8f6e\u8fa9\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u8bba\u70b9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Debater\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fa9\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models.

To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not.

However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute.

To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \\emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%.

Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aThought Gestalt (TG)\u7684\u9012\u5f52Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728token\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u5efa\u7acb\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u201c\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u6307\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "TG\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52Transformer\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210token\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00token\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u672a\u6765\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "TG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0eGPT-2\u76f8\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e865-8%\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u53ca33-42%\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53e5\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u53e5\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0cTG\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
