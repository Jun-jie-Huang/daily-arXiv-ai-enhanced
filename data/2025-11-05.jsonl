Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks.

We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge\ntype consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased\nhallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a\nparticular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,\nis a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect\nother knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we\npropose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in\nthe later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced\nhallucinations.

In contrast, using only the\ncurrent turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This\ntrade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,\nwe propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact\nmemory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses\nthe user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform\nsearch actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for\nsolving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn\ninteractions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize\nthis workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that\njointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of\nMemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher"}

Gormley"], "title": "Oolong: Evaluating Long Context Reasoning and Aggregation Capabilities", "comment": "Preprint", "summary": "As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models\neffectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully\ndesigned long-context evaluations have recently been released, these\nevaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,\nwhich allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This\nrepresents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We\nintroduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require\nanalyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating\nthese analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two\ntask sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can\neasily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a\ndownstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational\ndata. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to\nperform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over\ntemporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with\nGPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy\non both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong\nto enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities\nof text."}

In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the\ndecomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to\nagents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited\nto the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned\nCooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for\nlearning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks."}
