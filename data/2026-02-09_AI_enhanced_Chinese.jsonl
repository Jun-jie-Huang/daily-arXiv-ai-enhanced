However, advertising fatigue reduces the effectiveness of repeated slogans, creating a growing demand for novel, creative, and insightful slogan generation. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) for this task, existing approaches often produce stylistically redundant outputs that lack a clear brand persona and appear overtly machine-generated. We argue that effective slogans should balance novelty with familiarity and propose a new paradigm that recontextualizes persona-related famous quotes for slogan generation. Well-known quotes naturally align with slogan-length text, employ rich rhetorical devices, and offer depth and insight, making them a powerful resource for creative generation. Technically, we introduce a modular framework that decomposes slogan generation into interpretable subtasks, including quote matching, structural decomposition, vocabulary replacement, and remix generation. Extensive automatic and human evaluations demonstrate marginal improvements in diversity, novelty, emotional impact, and human preference over three state-of-the-art LLM baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u540d\u8a00\u6539\u5199\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53e3\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u53e3\u53f7\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u4e2a\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5e7f\u544a\u53e3\u53f7\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7f\u544a\u75b2\u52b3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53e3\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u4e4f\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u54c1\u724c\u4e2a\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u53e3\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53e3\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u540d\u8a00\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u91cd\u6df7\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5747\u6709\u8fb9\u9645\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u540d\u8a00\u91cd\u65b0\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u65b0\u9896\u53c8\u5bcc\u6709\u54c1\u724c\u4e2a\u6027\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u53e3\u53f7\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53e3\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted solution that enhances LVLMs by providing additional contexts from an external Knowledge Base. However, we observe that previous decoding methods for RAG are sub-optimal as they fail to sufficiently leverage multiple relevant contexts and suppress the negative effects of irrelevant contexts. To this end, we propose Relevance-aware Multi-context Contrastive Decoding (RMCD), a novel decoding method for RAG. RMCD outputs a final prediction by combining outputs predicted with each context, where each output is weighted based on its relevance to the question. By doing so, RMCD effectively aggregates useful information from multiple relevant contexts while also counteracting the negative effects of irrelevant ones. Experiments show that RMCD consistently outperforms other decoding methods across multiple LVLMs, achieving the best performance on three knowledge-intensive visual question-answering benchmarks. Also, RMCD can be simply applied by replacing the decoding method of LVLMs without additional training. Analyses also show that RMCD is robust to the retrieval results, consistently performing the best across the weakest to the strongest retrieval results.

However, most agent memory systems only emphasize semantic recall and treat experience as structures such as key-value, vector, or graph, which makes them struggle to represent and retrieve coherent events. To address this challenge, we propose a Character-and-Scene based memory architecture(CAST) inspired by dramatic theory. Specifically, CAST constructs 3D scenes (time/place/topic) and organizes them into character profiles that summarize the events of a character to represent episodic memory. Moreover, CAST complements this episodic memory with a graph-based semantic memory, which yields a robust dual memory design.

As the field enters the \"second half,\" the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations.

Focusing on models that range from 7 to 9 billion parameters in size engaged in a ten-round repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we evaluate whether short, costless pre-play messages emulating the cheap-talk paradigm affect strategic stability. Our analysis uses simulation-level bootstrap resampling and nonparametric inference to compare cooperation trajectories fitted with LOWESS regression across both the messaging and the no-messaging condition. We demonstrate consistent reductions in trajectory noise across a majority of the model-context pairings being studied. The stabilizing effect persists across multiple prompt variants and decoding regimes, though its magnitude depends on model choice and contextual framing, with models displaying higher baseline volatility gaining the most. While communication rarely produces harmful instability, we document a few context-specific exceptions and identify the limited domains in which communication harms stability.

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations.

However, existing models are restricted to a fixed role and voice, limiting their ability to support structured, role-driven real-world applications and personalized interactions. In this work, we introduce PersonaPlex, a duplex conversational speech model that incorporates hybrid system prompts, combining role conditioning with text prompts and voice cloning with speech samples. PersonaPlex is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of paired prompts and user-agent conversations, generated with open-source large language models (LLM) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. To evaluate role conditioning in real-world settings, we extend the Full-Duplex-Bench benchmark beyond a single assistant role to multi-role customer service scenarios. Experiments show that PersonaPlex achieves strong role-conditioned behavior, voice-conditioned speech, and natural conversational responsiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art duplex speech models and hybrid large language model-based speech systems in role adherence, speaker similarity, latency, and naturalness.", "AI": {"tldr": "PersonaPlex\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u5de5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u5de5\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7531\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "PersonaPlex\u5728\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53cc\u5de5\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "PersonaPlex\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

We provide a probabilistic framework for two dominant paradigms: code selection after generation using the execution environment, and code generation conditioned on environment feedback. First, we formalize several well-established selection heuristics as environment-aware estimators of code correctness. We theoretically prove that estimators based on fuzzy functional similarity add an inductive bias and strictly dominate estimators based on functional equivalence in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we frame backprompting as an in-context approximation of Thompson sampling. We derive a novel regret bound for reward functions with unobservable components, theoretically explaining why the effectiveness of backprompting is limited by the ambiguity of the informal task description (an irreducible regret). Using three state-of-the-art open weight models, we corroborate these findings across BigCodeBenchHard, LeetCodeDataset, and QiskitHumanEvalSim.

Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost. Overall, JBR makes PSRO substantially more practical for large-scale strategic learning while preserving equilibrium robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJBR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316PSRO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6216\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6781\u4e3a\u6602\u8d35\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdJoint Experience Best Response (JBR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9PSRO\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6536\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4fdd\u5b88JBR\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aJBR\u548c\u6df7\u5408BR\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aJBR\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6df7\u5408BR\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1PSRO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PSRO\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JBR\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dPSRO\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}

We present an automated mobile chaos testing system that integrates DragonCrawl, an LLM-based mobile testing platform, with uHavoc, a service-level fault injection system. The key insight is that adaptive AI-driven test execution can navigate mobile applications under degraded backend conditions, eliminating the need to manually write test cases for each combination of user flow, city, and failure type. Since Q1 2024, our system has executed over 180,000 automated chaos tests across 47 critical flows in Uber's Rider, Driver, and Eats applications, representing approximately 39,000 hours of manual testing effort that would be impractical at this scale. We identified 23 resilience risks, with 70% being architectural dependency violations where non-critical service failures degraded core user flows. Twelve issues were severe enough to prevent trip requests or food orders. Two caused application crashes detectable only through mobile chaos testing, not backend testing alone. Automated root cause analysis reduced debugging time from hours to minutes, achieving 88% precision@5 in attributing mobile failures to specific backend services. This paper presents the system design, evaluates its performance under fault injection (maintaining 99% test reliability), and reports operational experience demonstrating that continuous mobile resilience validation is achievable at production scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408AI\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eUber\u591a\u6b3e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u5f39\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u540e\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u6c8c\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684DragonCrawl\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0euHavoc\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u9a71\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea2024\u5e74Q1\u4ee5\u6765\u6267\u884c\u4e8618\u4e07\u4f59\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d647\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b023\u4e2a\u5f39\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b088%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8fbe\u523099%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u79fb\u52a8\u5f39\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u8c03\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

These restrictions render them insufficient for many subjective tasks such as toxicity and hate-speech detection. For this reason, we introduce a quantifiable metric, paired with a statistical significance test, that attributes polarization to various annotator groups. Our metric enables direct comparisons between heavily imbalanced sociodemographic and ideological subgroups across different datasets and tasks, while also enabling analysis on multi-label settings. We apply this metric to three datasets on hate speech, and one on toxicity detection, discovering that: (1) Polarization is strongly and persistently attributed to annotator race, especially on the hate speech task. (2) Religious annotators do not fundamentally disagree with each other, but do with other annotators, a trend that is gradually diminished and then reversed with irreligious annotators. (3) Less educated annotators are more subjective, while educated ones tend to broadly agree more between themselves. Overall, our results reflect current findings around annotation patterns for various subgroups.

In this vision paper, we re-examine what it means for an AI agent to be considered a software engineer and then critically think about what makes such an agent trustworthy. \\textit{Grounded} in established definitions of software engineering (SE) and informed by recent research on agentic AI systems, we conceptualise AI software engineers as participants in human-AI SE teams composed of human software engineers and AI models and tools, and we distinguish trustworthiness as a key property of these systems and actors rather than a subjective human attitude. Based on historical perspectives and emerging visions, we identify key dimensions that contribute to the trustworthiness of AI software engineers, spanning technical quality, transparency and accountability, epistemic humility, and societal and ethical alignment. We further discuss how trustworthiness can be evaluated and demonstrated, highlighting a fundamental trust measurement gap: not everything that matters for trust can be easily measured. Finally, we outline implications for the design, evaluation, and governance of AI SE systems, advocating for an ethics-by-design approach to enable appropriate trust in future human-AI SE teams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5efa\u7acb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u673a\u5236\u4e9f\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u65e2\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6280\u672f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c26\u900a\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u4f26\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u4f26\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u4f26\u7406\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step.

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentStepper\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8c03\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee3\u7406\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentStepper\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u4e3aLLM\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65ad\u70b9\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3002", "result": "AgentStepper\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u6b3e\u5148\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6539\u52a8\u5c11\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u627e\u5230bug\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentStepper\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families.

Automating this process is non-trivial because the information required for effective failure management is unstructured and cannot be automatically processed by traditional programs. With their ability to process unstructured data, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for automated failure management by previous work. Following these studies, we evaluated whether an LLM-based system could automate failure management in a CI/CD pipeline in the context of a large industrial software project, namely SAP HANA. We evaluated the ability of the LLM-based system to identify the error location and to propose exact solutions that contain no unnecessary actions. To support the LLM in generating exact solutions, we provided it with different types of domain knowledge, including pipeline information, failure management instructions, and data from historical failures. We conducted an ablation study to determine which type of domain knowledge contributed most to solution accuracy. The results show that data from historical failures contributed the most to the system's accuracy, enabling it to produce exact solutions in 92.1% of cases in our dataset. The system correctly identified the error location with 97.4% accuracy when provided with domain knowledge, compared to 84.2% accuracy without it.

While machine learning-based fault prediction models have demonstrated high accuracy, their lack of interpretability limits their adoption in industrial settings. Developers need actionable insights that can be directly employed in software quality assurance processes and guide defect mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present a structured process for defining context-specific software metric thresholds suitable for integration into fault detection workflows in industrial settings. Our approach supports cross-project fault prediction by deriving thresholds from one set of projects and applying them to independently developed firmware, thereby enabling reuse across similar software systems without retraining or domain-specific tuning. We analyze three real-world C-embedded firmware projects provided by an industrial partner, using Coverity and Understand static analysis tools to extract software metrics. Through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we identify discriminative metrics and derived empirical threshold values capable of distinguishing faulty from non-faulty functions. The derived thresholds are validated through an experimental evaluation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying fault-prone functions with high precision. The results confirm that the derived thresholds can serve as an interpretable solution for fault prediction, aligning with industry standards and SQA practices.

Existing automated repair methods typically rely on superficial pass/fail signals, offering limited visibility into program behavior and hindering precise error localization. In addition, without a way to learn from prior failures, repair processes often fall into repetitive and inefficient cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution.

We introduce the Medical Prompt Injection Benchmark (MPIB), a dataset-and-benchmark suite for evaluating clinical safety under both direct prompt injection and indirect, RAG-mediated injection across clinically grounded tasks. MPIB emphasizes outcome-level risk via the Clinical Harm Event Rate (CHER), which measures high-severity clinical harm events under a clinically grounded taxonomy, and reports CHER alongside Attack Success Rate (ASR) to disentangle instruction compliance from downstream patient risk. The benchmark comprises 9,697 curated instances constructed through multi-stage quality gates and clinical safety linting. Evaluating MPIB across a diverse set of baseline LLMs and defense configurations, we find that ASR and CHER can diverge substantially, and that robustness depends critically on whether adversarial instructions appear in the user query or in retrieved context. We release MPIB with evaluation code, adversarial baselines, and comprehensive documentation to support reproducible and systematic research on clinical prompt injection.

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reasoning over textual transcriptions for emotion recognition, they typically neglect fine-grained prosodic information, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. In this work, we propose VowelPrompt, a linguistically grounded framework that augments LLM-based emotion recognition with interpretable, fine-grained vowel-level prosodic cues. Drawing on phonetic evidence that vowels serve as primary carriers of affective prosody, VowelPrompt extracts pitch-, energy-, and duration-based descriptors from time-aligned vowel segments, and converts these features into natural language descriptions for better interpretability. Such a design enables LLMs to jointly reason over lexical semantics and fine-grained prosodic variation. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage adaptation procedure comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), implemented via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance reasoning capability, enforce structured output adherence, and improve generalization across domains and speaker variations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that VowelPrompt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods under zero-shot, fine-tuned, cross-domain, and cross-linguistic conditions, while enabling the generation of interpretable explanations that are jointly grounded in contextual semantics and fine-grained prosodic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVowelPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5143\u97f3\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u97f3\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u57fa\u9891\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u957f\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5e26\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cVowelPrompt\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u97f5\u5f8b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "VowelPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5143\u97f3\u5c42\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d outperform \u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Experiments on HotpotQA (sentence features) and a hand-labeled MMLU subset (word features) show that RoPE-LIME produces more informative attributions than leave-one-out sampling and improves over gSMILE while substantially reducing closed-model API calls.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u96be\u9898\uff0cRoPE-LIME\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u53ca\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684token\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7API\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoPE-LIME\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u6563\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684token\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eRoPE\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684Relaxed Word Mover's Distance\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u548cSparse-K\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728HotpotQA\uff08\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684MMLU\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRoPE-LIME\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u66f4\u5e7f\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4gSMILE\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578bAPI\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "RoPE-LIME\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cgSMILE\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578bAPI\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a meaningful solution should contain enough method-level information that, when applied to a neighborhood of related questions, it should yield better downstream performance than incorrect solutions. Building on this idea, we propose \\textbf{Consequence-Based Utility}, an oracle-free evaluator that scores each candidate by testing its value as an in-context exemplar in solving related yet verifiable questions. Our approach is evaluated on an original set of research-level math problems, each paired with one expert-written solution and nine LLM-generated solutions. Notably, Consequence-Based Utility consistently outperforms reward models, generative reward models, and LLM judges on ranking quality. Specifically, for GPT-OSS-120B, it improves Acc@1 from 67.2 to 76.3 and AUC from 71.4 to 79.6, with similarly large AUC gains on GPT-OSS-20B (69.0 to 79.2).

Disfluencies, repetition, ellipsis, and discourse-driven structure routinely violate standard Universal Dependencies (UD) assumptions, causing parsers and large language models (LLMs) to fail despite strong performance on written data. These failures are compounded by rigid evaluation metrics that conflate genuine structural errors with acceptable variation. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to spoken CSW parsing. We introduce a linguistically grounded taxonomy of spoken CSW phenomena and SpokeBench, an expert-annotated gold benchmark designed to test spoken-language structure beyond standard UD assumptions. We further propose FLEX-UD, an ambiguity-aware evaluation metric, which reveals that existing parsing techniques perform poorly on spoken CSW by penalizing linguistically plausible analyses as errors. We then propose DECAP, a decoupled agentic parsing framework that isolates spoken-phenomena handling from core syntactic analysis. Experiments show that DECAP produces more robust and interpretable parses without retraining and achieves up to 52.6% improvements over existing parsing techniques. FLEX-UD evaluations further reveal qualitative improvements that are masked by standard metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u53e3\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u5728\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53e3\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\uff08CSW\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65ad\u88c2\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u7701\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bdd\u8bed\u9a71\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f9d\u5b58\uff08UD\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53e3\u8bedCSW\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u53e3\u8bedCSW\u73b0\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684SpokeBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807FLEX-UD\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6DECAP\uff0c\u5c06\u53e3\u8bed\u73b0\u8c61\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDECAP\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe52.6%\u3002FLEX-UD\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53e3\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u53e5\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in this domain, their precise causal estimation capabilities are still limited, and the impact of post-training on these abilities is insufficiently explored. This paper examines the extent to which post-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for causal inference. We introduce CauGym, a comprehensive dataset comprising seven core causal tasks for training and five diverse test sets. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate five post-training approaches: SFT, DPO, KTO, PPO, and GRPO. Across five in-domain and four existing benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that appropriate post-training enables smaller LLMs to perform causal inference competitively, often surpassing much larger models. Our 14B parameter model achieves 93.5% accuracy on the CaLM benchmark, compared to 55.4% by OpenAI o3.

By reusing the frozen LLM's own parameters in an in-context hypernetwork design and introducing architectural innovations, SHINE overcomes key limitations of prior hypernetworks and achieves strong expressive power with a relatively small number of parameters. We introduce a pretraining and instruction fine-tuning pipeline, and train our hypernetwork to generate high quality LoRA adapters from diverse meaningful contexts in a single forward pass. It updates LLM parameters without any fine-tuning, and immediately enables complex question answering tasks related to the context without directly accessing the context, effectively transforming in-context knowledge to in-parameter knowledge in one pass.

However, for structured text classification problems with fixed label spaces, model selection is often driven by predictive performance alone, overlooking operational constraints encountered in production systems.\n  In this work, we present a systematic comparison of two contrasting paradigms for text classification: zero- and few-shot prompt-based large language models, and fully fine-tuned encoder-only architectures. We evaluate these approaches across four canonical benchmarks (IMDB, SST-2, AG News, and DBPedia), measuring predictive quality (macro F1), inference latency, and monetary cost.\n  We frame model evaluation as a multi-objective decision problem and analyze trade-offs using Pareto frontier projections and a parameterized utility function reflecting different deployment regimes. Our results show that fine-tuned encoder-based models from the BERT family achieve competitive, and often superior, classification performance while operating at one to two orders of magnitude lower cost and latency compared to zero- and few-shot LLM prompting.\n  Overall, our findings suggest that indiscriminate use of large language models for standard text classification workloads can lead to suboptimal system-level outcomes. Instead, fine-tuned encoders emerge as robust and efficient components for structured NLP pipelines, while LLMs are better positioned as complementary elements within hybrid architectures.

To address this, we introduce \\textbf{\\texttt{ReBeCA}} (self-\\textbf{\\texttt{Re}}flection \\textbf{\\texttt{Be}}havior explained through \\textbf{\\texttt{C}}ausal \\textbf{\\texttt{A}}nalysis), a framework that unveils the interpretable behavioral hierarchy governing the self-reflection outcome. By modeling self-reflection trajectories as causal graphs, ReBeCA isolates genuine determinants of performance through a three-stage Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) pipeline. We establish three critical findings: (1) \\textbf{Behavioral hierarchy:} Semantic behaviors of the model influence final self-reflection results hierarchically: directly or indirectly; (2) \\textbf{Causation matters:} Generalizability in self-reflection effects is limited to just a few semantic behaviors; (3) \\textbf{More $\\mathbf{\\neq}$ better:} The confluence of seemingly positive semantic behaviors, even among direct causal factors, can impair the efficacy of self-reflection.

In this work, we focus on Markdown formatting, which is ubiquitous in assistants, documentation, and tool-augmented pipelines but still prone to subtle, hard-to-detect errors (e.g., broken lists, malformed tables, inconsistent headings, and invalid code blocks) that can significantly degrade downstream usability. We present FMBench, a benchmark for adaptive Markdown output formatting that evaluates models under a wide range of instruction-following scenarios with diverse structural requirements. FMBench emphasizes real-world formatting behaviors such as multi-level organization, mixed content (natural language interleaved with lists/tables/code), and strict adherence to user-specified layout constraints. To improve Markdown compliance without relying on hard decoding constraints, we propose a lightweight alignment pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Starting from a base model, we first perform SFT on instruction-response pairs, and then optimize a composite objective that balances semantic fidelity with structural correctness. Experiments on two model families (OpenPangu and Qwen) show that SFT consistently improves semantic alignment, while reinforcement learning provides additional gains in robustness to challenging Markdown instructions when initialized from a strong SFT policy. Our results also reveal an inherent trade-off between semantic and structural objectives, highlighting the importance of carefully designed rewards for reliable formatted generation.

However, they still recompute the attention and feed-forward blocks for every token position at every step -- even when many unmasked tokens are essentially fixed, resulting in substantial waste in compute. We propose SureLock: when the posterior at an unmasked position has stabilized across steps (our sure condition), we lock that position -- thereafter skipping its query projection and feed-forward sublayers -- while caching its attention keys and values so other positions can continue to attend to it. This reduces the dominant per-iteration computational cost from $O(N^2d)$ to $O(MNd)$ where $N$ is the sequence length, $M$ is the number of unlocked token positions, and $d$ is the model dimension. In practice, $M$ decreases as the iteration progresses, yielding substantial savings. On LLaDA-8B, SureLock reduces algorithmic FLOPs by 30--50% relative to the same sampler without locking, while maintaining comparable generation quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify the design rationale of SureLock: monitoring only the local KL at the lock step suffices to bound the deviation in final token probabilities.

Existing LLM-based approaches rely on reasoning chains or self-improvement, which suffer from limited creativity and interpretability. To address these bottlenecks, we develop a novel LLM-based humor generation mechanism based on a fundamental humor theory, GTVH. To produce funny and script-opposite captions, we introduce a humor-theory-driven multi-role LLM collaboration framework augmented with humor retrieval (HOMER). The framework consists of three LLM-based roles: (1) conflicting-script extractor that grounds humor in key script oppositions, forming the basis of caption generation; (2) retrieval-augmented hierarchical imaginator that identifies key humor targets and expands the creative space of them through diverse associations structured as imagination trees; and (3) caption generator that produces funny and diverse captions conditioned on the obtained knowledge.

Prior jailbreaking research has explored diverse approaches, including prompt optimization, automated red teaming, obfuscation, and reinforcement learning (RL) based methods. However, most existing techniques fail to effectively leverage vulnerabilities revealed in earlier interaction turns, resulting in inefficient and unstable attacks. Since jailbreaking involves sequential interactions in which each response influences future actions, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for this problem. Motivated by this, we propose a history-aware RL-based jailbreak framework that analyzes and reweights vulnerability signals from prior steps to guide future decisions. We show that incorporating historical information alone improves jailbreak success rates. Building on this insight, we introduce an attention-based reweighting mechanism that highlights critical vulnerabilities within the interaction history, enabling more efficient exploration with fewer queries. Extensive experiments on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak performance while significantly improving query efficiency. These results underscore the importance of historical vulnerability signals in reinforcement learning-driven jailbreak strategies and offer a principled pathway for advancing adversarial research on LLM safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6f0f\u6d1e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8d8a\u72f1\u6280\u672f\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u8d8a\u72f1\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u975e\u5e38\u5951\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u5148\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d8a\u72f1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728AdvBench\u548cHarmBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u8d8a\u72f1\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This limitation is particularly acute in light-parameter LLMs which are essential for privacy-preserving and efficient clinical deployment. Existing training paradigms prioritize linguistic fluency over structured clinical logic and result in a fundamental misalignment with professional diagnostic cognition. Here we introduce ClinMPO, a reinforcement learning framework designed to align the internal reasoning of LLMs with professional psychiatric practice. The framework employs a specialized reward model trained independently on a dataset derived from 4,474 psychiatry journal articles and structured according to evidence-based medicine principles. We evaluated ClinMPO on a unseen subset of the benchmark designed to isolate reasoning capabilities from rote memorization. This test set comprises items where leading large-parameter LLMs consistently fail. We compared the ClinMPO-aligned light LLM performance against a cohort of 300 medical students.

A key challenge is that generation difficulty varies within a single output, whereas existing efficiency-oriented approaches either ignore this intra-generation variation or rely on supervised token-level routing with high system complexity. We present \\textbf{RelayGen}, a training-free, segment-level runtime model switching framework that exploits difficulty variation in long-form reasoning. Through offline analysis of generation uncertainty using token probability margins, we show that coarse-grained segment-level control is sufficient to capture difficulty transitions within a reasoning trajectory. RelayGen identifies model-specific switch cues that signal transitions to lower-difficulty segments and dynamically delegates their continuation to a smaller model, while preserving high-difficulty reasoning on the large model. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, RelayGen substantially reduces inference latency while preserving most of the accuracy of large models.

As a result, recent work is increasing the focus on continual learning from real-world deployment, where user interaction logs provide a rich source of authentic human feedback and procedural knowledge. However, learning from user logs is challenging due to their unstructured and noisy nature. Vanilla LLM systems often struggle to distinguish useful feedback signals from noisy user behavior, and the disparity between user log collection and model optimization (e.g., the off-policy optimization problem) further strengthens the problem. To this end, we propose UNO (User log-driveN Optimization), a unified framework for improving LLM systems (LLMsys) with user logs. UNO first distills logs into semi-structured rules and preference pairs, then employs query-and-feedback-driven clustering to manage data heterogeneity, and finally quantifies the cognitive gap between the model's prior knowledge and the log data. This assessment guides the LLMsys to adaptively filter out noisy feedback and construct different modules for primary and reflective experiences extracted from user logs, thereby improving future responses.

Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218Transformer\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84FFN\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ehourglass\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6df1\u5c42FFN\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bbd-\u7a84-\u5bbdMLP\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86Transformer\u4e2d\u4e00\u76f4\u4ee5\u6765\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84MLP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u60ef\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u4e2d\u7684FFN\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684hourglass\u5f62\u72b6FFN\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "hourglass FFN\u5728400M\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c1B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574FFN\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8ehourglass\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6df1\u5c42FFN\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a84-\u5bbd-\u7a84FFN\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c0fFFN\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While LLMs and LLM-human hybrid strategies reduce costly human effort, they remain prone to LLM overconfidence and ineffective AI-to-human escalation. To address this, we propose DREAM, a multi-round debate-based relevance assessment framework with LLM agents, built on opposing initial stances and iterative reciprocal critique. Through our agreement-based debate, it yields more accurate labeling for certain cases and more reliable AI-to-human escalation for uncertain ones, achieving 95.2% labeling accuracy with only 3.5% human involvement. Using DREAM, we build BRIDGE, a refined benchmark that mitigates evaluation bias and enables fairer retriever comparison by uncovering 29,824 missing relevant chunks. We then re-benchmark IR systems and extend evaluation to RAG, showing that unaddressed holes not only distort retriever rankings but also drive retrieval-generation misalignment.

We introduce Inference-Time Rethinking, a generative framework that enables iterative self-correction by decoupling declarative latent thought vectors from procedural generation. We factorize reasoning into a continuous latent thought vector (what to reason about) and a decoder that verbalizes the trace conditioned on this vector (how to reason). Beyond serving as a declarative buffer, latent thought vectors compress the reasoning structure into a continuous representation that abstracts away surface-level token variability, making gradient-based optimization over reasoning strategies well-posed. Our prior model maps unstructured noise to a learned manifold of valid reasoning patterns, and at test time we employ a Gibbs-style procedure that alternates between generating a candidate trace and optimizing the latent vector to better explain that trace, effectively navigating the latent manifold to refine the reasoning strategy. Training a 0.2B-parameter model from scratch on GSM8K, our method with 30 rethinking iterations surpasses baselines with 10 to 15 times more parameters, including a 3B counterpart.

Recent work has addressed this problem by scaling self-consistency and parallel thinking, adding generic ``thinking tokens'' and prompting models to re-read the question before answering. Unfortunately, these approaches either inject task-agnostic tokens or mandate heuristics that do not explain -- and often ignore -- the \\emph{spontaneous} repetition that many LRMs exhibit at the head of their internal chains. In contrast, we analyze and harness the model's tendency to restate the question, which we term the \\emph{Echo of Prompt (EOP)}, as a front-loaded, compute-shaping mechanism. We formalize its probabilistic cost by casting echo removal as rejection-based conditioning and defining the \\emph{Echo Likelihood Gap} $\u0394\\mathcal{L}$ as a computable proxy. This provides the missing theoretical link that links early repetition to likelihood gains and downstream accuracy. However, it does not by itself specify how to exploit EOP. Consequently, we develop \\emph{Echo-Distilled SFT (ED-SFT)} to instill an ``echo-then-reason'' pattern through supervised finetuning, and \\emph{Echoic Prompting (EP)} to re-ground the model mid-trace without training. While promising, quantifying benefits beyond verbosity is non-trivial. Therefore, we conduct length and suffix-controlled likelihood analyses together with layer-wise attention studies, showing that EOP increases answer to answer-prefix attention in middle layers, consistent with an \\emph{attention refocusing} mechanism. We evaluate on GSM8K, MathQA, Hendrycks-MATH, AIME24, and MATH-500 under identical decoding settings and budgets, and find consistent gains over baselines.

Mitigating Toxicity from LLM Generations through Subspace Intervention", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful text generators, yet they can produce toxic or harmful content even when given seemingly harmless prompts. This presents a serious safety challenge and can cause real-world harm. Toxicity is often subtle and context-dependent, making it difficult to detect at the token level or through coarse sentence-level signals. Moreover, efforts to mitigate toxicity often face a trade-off between safety and the coherence, or fluency of the generated text. In this work, we present a targeted subspace intervention strategy for identifying and suppressing hidden toxic patterns from underlying model representations, while preserving overall ability to generate safe fluent content.

To address these issues, we propose FairJudge, an adaptive, debiased, and consistent LLM-as-a-Judge. Unlike prior approaches that treat the judge as a static evaluator, FairJudge models judging behavior itself as a learnable and regularized policy. From a data-centric perspective, we construct a high-information-density judging dataset that explicitly injects supervision signals aligned with evaluation behavior. Building on this dataset, we adopt a curriculum-style SFT-DPO-GRPO training paradigm that progressively aligns rubric adherence, bias mitigation, and cross-mode consistency, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1CRC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Selective Layer Restoration\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u6062\u590d\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c42\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "SLR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6062\u590d\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns.

Using Ekman's six basic emotions (e.g., joy, disgust), we examine various prompting techniques, including Zero-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting using gpt-3.5-turbo, and compare it to fine-tuning. Our results indicate that prompt engineering effectively steers emotions in AI-generated texts, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning, especially in data-constrained settings.

This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems.

To enhance robustness, recent work shifts toward Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) that generate rationales before predicting preferences. Yet in GenRM training and evaluation, practice remains outcome-label-only, leaving reasoning quality unchecked. We show that reasoning fidelity-the consistency between a GenRM's preference decision and reference decision rationales-is highly predictive of downstream RLHF outcomes, beyond standard label accuracy. Specifically, we repurpose existing reward-model benchmarks to compute Spurious Correctness (S-Corr)-the fraction of label-correct decisions with rationales misaligned with golden judgments. Our empirical evaluation reveals substantial S-Corr even for competitive GenRMs, and higher S-Corr is associated with policy degeneration under optimization. To improve fidelity, we propose Rationale-Centric Alignment, R-Align, which augments training with gold judgments and explicitly supervises rationale alignment. R-Align reduces S-Corr on RM benchmarks and yields consistent gains in actor performance across STEM, coding, instruction following, and general tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9RLHF\u8868\u73b0\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u63d0\u51faR-Align\u65b9\u6cd5\u76d1\u7763\u7406\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u672a\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdRLHF\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5R-Align\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u5224\u65ad\u76d1\u7763\u7406\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eS-Corr\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0cR-Align\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86S-Corr\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728STEM\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08GenRM\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u7684RLHF\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5R-Align\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose a data-driven approach to automatically construct highly granular reasoning error taxonomies to enhance LLM-driven error detection on unseen reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that classification approaches that leverage these error taxonomies, or \"rubrics\", demonstrate strong error identification compared to baseline methods in technical domains like coding, math, and chemical engineering. These rubrics can be used to build stronger LLM-as-judge reward functions for reasoning model training via reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that these rewards have the potential to improve models' task accuracy on difficult domains over models trained by general LLMs-as-judges by +45%, and approach performance of models trained by verifiable rewards while using as little as 20% as many gold labels. Through our approach, we extend the usage of reward rubrics from assessing qualitative model behavior to assessing quantitative model correctness on tasks typically learned via RLVR rewards.

To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains.

While prior work has discovered evidence for both, a mechanistic account of how these properties coexist and transform across tasks remains elusive. We propose that representational sharing lies not in the concepts themselves, but in the geometric relations between them. Using number concepts as a testbed and language models as high-dimensional computational substrates, we show that number representations preserve a stable relational structure across tasks. Task-specific representations are embedded in distinct subspaces, with low-level features like magnitude and parity encoded along separable linear directions. Crucially, we find that these subspaces are largely transformable into one another via linear mappings, indicating that representations share relational structure despite being located in distinct subspaces. Together, these results provide a mechanistic lens of how language models balance the shared structure of number representation with functional flexibility. It suggests that understanding arises when task-specific transformations are applied to a shared underlying relational structure of conceptual representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u5b57\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u517c\u987e\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u805a\u5408\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6d41\u5f62\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6216\u5206\u6563\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u5b58\u53ca\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u6709\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5947\u5076\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u95f4\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u4e92\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u4fdd\u6301\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

Yet existing approaches break under exploration complexity and intent drift. We propose SEMA, a simple yet effective framework that trains a multi-turn attacker without relying on any existing strategies or external data. SEMA comprises two stages. Prefilling self-tuning enables usable rollouts by fine-tuning on non-refusal, well-structured, multi-turn adversarial prompts that are self-generated with a minimal prefix, thereby stabilizing subsequent learning. Reinforcement learning with intent-drift-aware reward trains the attacker to elicit valid multi-turn adversarial prompts while maintaining the same harmful objective. We anchor harmful intent in multi-turn jailbreaks via an intent-drift-aware reward that combines intent alignment, compliance risk, and level of detail. Our open-loop attack regime avoids dependence on victim feedback, unifies single- and multi-turn settings, and reduces exploration complexity. Across multiple datasets, victim models, and jailbreak judges, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack success rates (ASR), outperforming all single-turn baselines, manually scripted and template-driven multi-turn baselines, as well as our SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) variants. For instance, SEMA performs an average $80.1\\%$ ASR@1 across three closed-source and open-source victim models on AdvBench, 33.9% over SOTA. The approach is compact, reproducible, and transfers across targets, providing a stronger and more realistic stress test for large language model (LLM) safety and enabling automatic redteaming to expose and localize failure modes.

We formalize this phenomenon as cross-objective interference and conduct the first systematic study across classic scalarization algorithms, showing that interference is pervasive and exhibits strong model dependence.\n  To explain this phenomenon, we derive a local covariance law showing that an objective improves at first order when its reward exhibits positive covariance with the scalarized score. We extend this analysis to clipped surrogate objectives used in modern alignment, demonstrating that the covariance law remains valid under mild conditions despite clipping. Building on this analysis, we propose Covariance Targeted Weight Adaptation (CTWA), a plug-and-play method that maintains positive covariance between objective rewards and the training signal to effectively mitigate cross-objective interference.

While recent models show strong performance on English-centric benchmarks, their behavior across languages, tasks, and hallucination types is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce Halluverse-M^3, a dataset designed to enable systematic analysis of hallucinations across multiple languages, multiple generation tasks, and multiple hallucination categories. Halluverse-M^3 covers four languages, English, Arabic, Hindi, and Turkish, and supports two generation tasks: question answering and dialogue summarization. The dataset explicitly distinguishes between entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. Hallucinated outputs are constructed through a controlled editing process and validated by human annotators, ensuring clear alignment between original content and hallucinated generations. Using this dataset, we evaluate a diverse set of contemporary open-source and proprietary language models on fine-grained hallucination detection. Our results show that question answering is consistently easier than dialogue summarization, while sentence-level hallucinations remain challenging even for the strongest models. Performance is highest in English and degrades in lower-resource languages, with Hindi exhibiting the lowest detection accuracy. Overall, Halluverse-M^3 provides a realistic and challenging benchmark for studying hallucinations in multilingual, multi-task settings. We release the dataset to support future research on hallucination detection and mitigation\\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/sabdalja/HalluVerse-M3}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHalluverse-M^3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea7\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u800c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "Halluverse-M^3 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u96be\u6613\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a \"subwords manifest\", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models.

However, constrained by the quality--speed trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt conservative parallel strategies, leaving substantial efficiency potential underexplored. A core challenge is that parallel decoding assumes each position can be filled independently, but tokens are often semantically coupled. Thus, the correct choice at one position constrains valid choices at others. Without modeling these inter-token dependencies, parallel strategies produce deteriorated outputs. Motivated by this insight, we propose DAWN, a training-free, dependency-aware decoding method for fast dLLM inference. DAWN extracts token dependencies and leverages two key motivations: (1) positions dependent on unmasked certain positions become more reliable, (2) simultaneously unmasking strongly coupled uncertain positions induces errors. Given those findings, DAWN leverages a dependency graph to select more reliable unmasking positions at each iteration, achieving high parallelism with negligible loss in generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that DAWN speedups the inference by 1.80-8.06x over baselines while preserving the generation quality.

Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "InftyThink+\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u603b\u7ed3\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInftyThink+\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7ee7\u7eed\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cInftyThink+\u5728AIME24\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad821%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "InftyThink+\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}
