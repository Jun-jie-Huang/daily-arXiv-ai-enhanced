Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Crystal-KV\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b54\u6848\u4f18\u5148\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u6dd8\u6c70\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5b58\u50a8\u5f15\u8d77KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9CoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u4f18\u5148\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u76ee\u5206\u4e3aSlipKV\u548cCrystalKV\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u6700\u5c11\u9891\u7e41\u4f7f\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u7cbe\u51c6\u6dd8\u6c70\u65e0\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u5c42\u548c\u5934\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCrystal-KV\u7684\u9ad8\u6548KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7b54\u6848\u4f18\u5148\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u76ee\u5206\u4e3aSlipKV\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5bfc\uff09\u548cCrystalKV\uff08\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u5927\uff09\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u6700\u5c11\u9891\u7e41\u4f7f\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6dd8\u6c70\u65e0\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7f13\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Crystal-KV\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u7f13\u5b58\u6761\u76ee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7f13\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Most existing RM evaluations rely on static, pre-annotated preference datasets, which provide limited coverage and often fail to faithfully assess generalization in open-world settings. We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks.

In this paper, we introduce a general framework for adapting sequence-labeling-based NER models to produce uncertainty-aware prediction sets. These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage.

We directly evaluate it in a fully tabular predator-prey gridworld by comparing independent and centralized Q-learning under explicit embodiment constraints on agent speed and stamina. Across multiple kinematic regimes and asymmetric agent roles, centralized learning fails to provide a consistent advantage and is frequently outperformed by fully independent learning, even under full observability and exact value estimation. Moreover, asymmetric centralized-independent configurations induce persistent coordination breakdowns rather than transient learning instability. By eliminating confounding effects from function approximation and representation learning, our tabular analysis isolates coordination structure as the primary driver of these effects. The results show that increased coordination can become a liability under embodiment constraints, and that the effectiveness of centralized learning is fundamentally regime and role dependent rather than universal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u786e\u5b9e\u6539\u5584\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u683c\u5316\u7684\u6355\u98df\u8005-\u730e\u7269\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u72ec\u7acbQ\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0fQ\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f53\u529b\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5d29\u6e83\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u534f\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4ef7\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u5907\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u4f53\u529b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, from fine-tuned transformers to large language models, apply a uniform reasoning strategy to all inputs, struggling to address the diverse analytical demands of sarcasm. These demands range from modeling contextual expectation violations to requiring external knowledge grounding or recognizing specific rhetorical patterns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAM-SD, a Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent framework for Sarcasm Detection. The framework operates through four stages: (1) contextual retrieval grounds the query in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic exemplars; (2) a meta-planner classifies the sarcasm type and selects an optimal reasoning plan from a predefined set; (3) an ensemble of specialized agents performs complementary, multi-view analysis; and (4) an integrator synthesizes these analyses into a final, interpretable judgment with a natural language explanation. Evaluated on four standard benchmarks, RAM-SD achieves a state-of-the-art Macro-F1 of 77.74%, outperforming the strong GPT-4o+CoC baseline by 7.01 points. Our framework not only sets a new performance benchmark but also provides transparent and interpretable reasoning traces, illuminating the cognitive processes behind sarcasm comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRAM-SD\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e92\u8865\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u817b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u591a\u7ef4\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbd\u523a\u8868\u8fbe\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bbd\u523a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAM-SD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u8bbd\u523a\u4e0e\u975e\u8bbd\u523a\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5206\u7c7b\u8bbd\u523a\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u4e92\u8865\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5668\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cRAM-SD\u53d6\u5f9777.74%\u7684Macro-F1\uff0c\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfGPT-4o+CoC\u63d0\u53477.01\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "RAM-SD\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bbd\u523a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbd\u523a\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is one of the key measures to mitigate congestion, and recent studies have increasingly applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) for its adaptive capabilities. With respect to SUMO and CityFlow, the simulator Vissim offers high-fidelity driver behavior modeling and wide industrial adoption but remains underutilized in RL research due to its complex interface and lack of standardized frameworks. To address this gap, this paper proposes VissimRL, a modular RL framework for TSC that encapsulates Vissim's COM interface through a high-level Python API, offering standardized environments for both single- and multi-agent training. Experiments show that VissimRL significantly reduces development effort while maintaining runtime efficiency, and supports consistent improvements in traffic performance during training, as well as emergent coordination in multi-agent control. Overall, VissimRL demonstrates the feasibility of applying RL in high-fidelity simulations and serves as a bridge between academic research and practical applications in intelligent traffic signal control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fVissim\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6VissimRL\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a5\u53e3\u590d\u6742\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f7f\u7528SUMO\u548cCityFlow\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0cVissim\u867d\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u63a5\u53e3\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c01\u88c5Vissim\u7684COM\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7API\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VissimRL\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ea7Python API\u5c01\u88c5Vissim\u7684COM\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4ea4\u901a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VissimRL\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u79d1\u7814\u6210\u679c\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In computational linguistics, fear is primarily studied as an emotion, but not as a distinct form of speech. Fear speech content is widespread and growing, and often outperforms hate-speech content in reach and engagement because it appears \"civiler\" and evades moderation. Yet the computational study of fear speech remains fragmented and under-resourced. This can be understood by recognizing that fear speech is a phenomenon shaped by contributions from multiple disciplines. In this paper, we bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives by comparing theories of fear from Psychology, Political science, Communication science, and Linguistics. Building on this, we review existing definitions. We follow up with a survey of datasets from related research areas and propose a taxonomy that consolidates different dimensions of fear for studying fear speech. By reviewing current datasets and defining core concepts, our work offers both theoretical and practical guidance for creating datasets and advancing fear speech research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6574\u5408\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u8fdc\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u5458\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u66f4\u201c\u6587\u660e\u201d\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u89c4\u907f\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u68b3\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\u6574\u5408\u548c\u68b3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6050\u60e7\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing taint analysis tools are predominantly designed for single languages, requiring substantial engineering effort that scales with language diversity. While multi-language tools like CodeQL, Joern, and WALA attempt to address these challenges, they face limitations in intermediate representation design, analysis precision, and extensibility, which make them difficult to scale effectively for large-scale industrial applications at Ant Group. To bridge this gap, we present YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer), a unified multi-language static taint analysis framework designed for industrial-scale deployment. Specifically, YASA introduces the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) that provides a unified abstraction for compatibility across diverse programming languages. Building on the UAST, YASA performs point-to analysis and taint propagation, leveraging a unified semantic model to manage language-agnostic constructs, while incorporating language-specific semantic models to handle other unique language features. When compared to 6 single- and 2 multi-language static analyzers on an industry-standard benchmark, YASA consistently outperformed all baselines across Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. In real-world deployment within Ant Group, YASA analyzed over 100 million lines of code across 7.3K internal applications. It identified 314 previously unknown taint paths, with 92 of them confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities were responsibly reported, with 76 already patched by internal development teams, demonstrating YASA's practical effectiveness for securing large-scale industrial software systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "YASA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9759\u6001\u6c61\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7UAST\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u4f01\u4e1a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u6808\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08UAST\uff09\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u6c61\u70b9\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6YASA\u3002", "result": "YASA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e6\u4e2a\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\u548c2\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5728\u8682\u8681\u96c6\u56e2\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u5206\u6790\u4e867.3K\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0314\u6761\u672a\u77e5\u6c61\u70b9\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d92\u6761\u4e3a\u96f6\u65e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u670976\u6761\u88ab\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "YASA\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9759\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u969c\u5927\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We propose dynamic role assignment, a framework that runs a Meta-Debate to select suitable agents before the actual debate. The meta-debate has two stages: (1) proposal, where candidates provide role-tailored arguments, and (2) peer review, where proposals are scored with data and role-specific criteria to choose the best agent for each position. We evaluate our method on LLM problem solving benchmarks. Applied on top of existing debate systems, our approach consistently outperforms uniform assignments (filling all roles with the same model) by up to 74.8% and random assignments (assigning models to roles without considering their suitability) by up to 29.7%, depending on the task and the specific assignment.

With 41 features spanning commit messages, PR structure, and code characteristics, we achieve 97.2% F1-score in multi-class agent identification.

Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790RNN\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46RNN\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53e5\u5b50\u89c6\u4e3aRNN\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790RNN\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53e5\u5b50\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u7684SNIPS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u88ab\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u5404\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7c07\u3002\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684ATIS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u60f3\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u88ab\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u4f4e\u9891\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u8bfb\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u79bb\u5f00\u6765\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RNN\u89e3\u51b3\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3RNN\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first systematic analysis of how LLMs behave when tasked with demographic-conditioned targeted messaging. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u6709\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u5236\u6d88\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GPT-4o\u3001Llama-3.3\u548cMistral-Large 2.1\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4e30\u5bcc\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u4ea4\u6d41\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u5f3a\u8c03\u884c\u52a8\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u548c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u5173\u6000\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u7537\u6027\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u5f3a\u8c03\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u548c\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u5973\u6027\u548c\u8001\u5e74\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5219\u66f4\u5f3a\u8c03\u6e29\u60c5\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u504f\u89c1\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDALIA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fde\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5c42DALIA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u5f55\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "DALIA\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b8c\u6210\u3002"}}

Existing QA benchmarks rarely capture this distinction, particularly in multilingual and long-form settings. We introduce MentorQA, the first multilingual dataset and evaluation framework for mentorship-focused question answering from long-form videos, comprising nearly 9,000 QA pairs from 180 hours of content across four languages. We define mentorship-focused evaluation dimensions that go beyond factual accuracy, capturing clarity, alignment, and learning value. Using MentorQA, we compare Single-Agent, Dual-Agent, RAG, and Multi-Agent QA architectures under controlled conditions. Multi-Agent pipelines consistently produce higher-quality mentorship responses, with especially strong gains for complex topics and lower-resource languages.

These mappings have been found to support efficient communication; however, this theory does not account for systematic relations within word forms. We examine how a restricted set of grammatical meanings (e.g. person, number) are expressed on verbs and pronouns across typologically diverse languages. Consistent with prior work, we find that verb and pronoun forms are shaped by competing communicative pressures for simplicity (minimizing the inventory of grammatical distinctions) and accuracy (enabling recovery of intended meanings). Crucially, our proposed model uses a novel measure of complexity (inverse of simplicity) based on the learnability of meaning-to-form mappings.

While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines \"structure+variable\" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding.

However, figurative language, such as sarcasm, humor, and metaphor, remains a significant challenge, as it conveys intent and emotion through subtle incongruities between expressed and intended meanings. In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models. Our findings show that lightweight VLMs with verifiable reasoning achieve robust cross-style generalization while providing inspectable reasoning traces for multimodal tasks.

The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u89d2\u7578\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u89d2\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u536b\u661f\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MAGSAC++\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548cYOLO11\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u6b63\u5c04\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8eClickHouse\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u987b\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u901f\u53ca\u5236\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u5b9e\u5730\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316\u9053\u8def\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u53ca\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Presented at the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing (GeBNLP 2019)", "summary": "Modern models for common NLP tasks often employ machine learning techniques and train on journalistic, social media, or other culturally-derived text. These have recently been scrutinized for racial and gender biases, rooting from inherent bias in their training text. These biases are often sub-optimal and recent work poses methods to rectify them; however, these biases may shed light on actual racial or gender gaps in the culture(s) that produced the training text, thereby helping us understand cultural context through big data. This paper presents an approach for quantifying gender bias in word embeddings, and then using them to characterize statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health. We validate these metrics on 2018 Twitter data spanning 51 U.S. regions and 99 countries. We correlate state and country word embedding biases with 18 international and 5 U.S.-based statistical gender gaps, characterizing regularities and predictive strength.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e2018\u5e74\u63a8\u7279\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u5730\u533a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dNLP\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57282018\u5e74\u63a8\u7279\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6db5\u76d651\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5730\u533a\u548c99\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u672c\u571f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u3002"}}

Agentic PRs differ substantially from Human PRs in commit count (Cliff's $\u03b4= 0.5429$) and show moderate differences in files touched and deleted lines.

However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DF-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bQA\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u8fb9\u9645\u76f8\u5173\uff08Maximal Marginal Relevance\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0cDF-RAG\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u65e2\u76f8\u5173\u53c8\u76f8\u4e92\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "DF-RAG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd54-10%\u7684F1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cDF-RAG\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u5347\u768491.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "DF-RAG\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u63d0\u5347\u4e864-10%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1Oracle\u4e0a\u965091.3%\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u501f\u52a9Claude Code\u7684Opus 4.5\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7107\u6761\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u529f\u80fd\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001bug\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u7b49\uff09\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a7420\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u7a97\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a7\u4ef6\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u83dc\u5355\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u6811\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u684c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4fdd\u6301\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In parallel, process supervision has long been explored as a way to shape the intermediate reasoning behaviour of LLMs, but existing approaches rely on neural judges to score chain-of-thought steps, leaving them vulnerable to opacity, bias, and reward hacking. To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u501a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VPRMs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u501a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08VPRMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u8bc4\u5206\u8fde\u9501\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u7efc\u5408\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u501a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cVPRMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cF1\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u8f83\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u53476.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VPRMs\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool.

In this work, we explore reinforcement learning (d-RLAIF) as a post-training alternative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We first apply Todorov's Theory of Narrative Equilibrium to establish principles that define desirable ASG qualities. We prompt 7B and 14B LLM-as-judge models with our principles to test alignment with human annotators and provide reward signals during d-RLAIF.

The dataset consists of 6,294 claims categorized as Supported, Refuted, or Overruled. We construct this benchmark using a multi-stage pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize claims from expert case summaries, employing a novel semantic similarity heuristic to efficiently identify and verify complex legal overrulings. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that the task remains challenging; notably, augmenting models with unrestricted web search degrades performance compared to closed-book baselines due to the retrieval of noisy, non-authoritative precedents.

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations).

We introduce a new large-scale, multilingual dataset to address this critical gap. It contains 78,503 synthetic claims grounded in 434 complex OECD tables, which average over 500K rows each. We propose a novel, frame-guided methodology where algorithms programmatically select significant data points based on six semantic frames to generate realistic claims in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Hindi. Crucially, we demonstrate through knowledge-probing experiments that LLMs have not memorized these facts, forcing systems to perform genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than relying on parameterized knowledge. We provide a baseline SQL-generation system and show that our benchmark is highly challenging.

Static analysis is sound but often over-approximates, producing many false positives, whereas machine-learning approaches can improve precision but may sacrifice completeness and generalization. We present iResolveX, a hybrid multi-layered framework that combines conservative static analysis with learning-based refinement. The first layer applies a conservative value-set analysis (BPA) to ensure high recall. The second layer adds a learning-based soft-signature scorer (iScoreGen) and selective inter-procedural backward analysis with memory inspection (iScoreRefine) to reduce false positives. The final output, p-IndirectCFG, annotates indirect edges with confidence scores, enabling downstream analyses to choose appropriate precision--recall trade-offs. Across SPEC CPU2006 and real-world binaries, iScoreGen reduces predicted targets by 19.2% on average while maintaining BPA-level recall (98.2%). Combined with iScoreRefine, the total reduction reaches 44.3% over BPA with 97.8% recall (a 0.4% drop). iResolveX supports both conservative, recall-preserving and F1-optimized configurations and outperforms state-of-the-art systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "iResolveX\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8bef\u62a5\u591a\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u503c\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u786e\u4fdd\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u7b7e\u540d\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u56de\u6eaf\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u67e5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff1b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528CFG\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86iResolveX\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5b88\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u503c\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8f6f\u7b7e\u540d\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u56de\u6eaf\u5206\u6790\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u56fe\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ciResolveX\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "iResolveX\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6743\u8861\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided \"Clarify-Before-Answer\" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java.

On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%.

By analyzing the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge and summarizing recent advances in meta-judging by LLMs, we argue that LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge offers a promising direction for more stable and trustworthy automated evaluation, while highlighting remaining challenges related to cost, prompt sensitivity, and shared model biases, which must be addressed to advance the next generation of LLM evaluation methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7684\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5197\u957f\u548c\u865a\u5047\u7406\u7531\u7b49\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u516d\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness.

In particular, an LLM agent may pursue objectives that deviate from human values and ethical norms, a risk known as value misalignment. Existing evaluations primarily focus on responses to explicit harmful input or robustness against system failure, while value misalignment in realistic, fully benign, and agentic settings remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we first formalize the Loss-of-Control risk and identify the previously underexamined Intrinsic Value Misalignment (Intrinsic VM). We then introduce IMPRESS (Intrinsic Value Misalignment Probes in REalistic Scenario Set), a scenario-driven framework for systematically assessing this risk. Following our framework, we construct benchmarks composed of realistic, fully benign, and contextualized scenarios, using a multi-stage LLM generation pipeline with rigorous quality control. We evaluate Intrinsic VM on 21 state-of-the-art LLM agents and find that it is a common and broadly observed safety risk across models. Moreover, the misalignment rates vary by motives, risk types, model scales, and architectures. While decoding strategies and hyperparameters exhibit only marginal influence, contextualization and framing mechanisms significantly shape misalignment behaviors. Finally, we conduct human verification to validate our automated judgments and assess existing mitigation strategies, such as safety prompting and guardrails, which show instability or limited effectiveness. We further demonstrate key use cases of IMPRESS across the AI Ecosystem.

Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub", "comment": null, "summary": "In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes.

However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "OpenSSF Scorecard\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u8fc7\u53bb90\u5929\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b(VARMA)\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b(\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797)\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b(LSTM)\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u5206\u6876\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b49\u7ea7\u548c\u8d8b\u52bf\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8fc70.95\u548c0.80\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709Scorecard\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference.

A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).

The use of language models to reduce the human cost of peer review has been actively explored as a potential solution to this challenge. A method has been proposed to evaluate the level of substantiation in scientific reviews in a manner that is interpretable by humans. This method extracts the core components of an argument, claims and evidence, and assesses the level of substantiation based on the proportion of claims supported by evidence. The level of substantiation refers to the extent to which claims are based on objective facts. However, when assessing the level of substantiation, simply detecting the presence or absence of supporting evidence for a claim is insufficient; it is also necessary to accurately assess the logical inference between a claim and its evidence. We propose a new evaluation metric for scientific review comments that assesses the logical inference between claims and evidence.

In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by Gonz\u00e1lez Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf92019-2023\u5e74\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u534a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f3a\u9677\u6613\u53d1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u671f\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e862019\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u95f4SCOPUS\u7d22\u5f15\u7684101\u7bc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u62a5\u544a\u7b26\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Gonz\u00e1lez Barahona \u548c Robles \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6\u7684101\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\u4ece1\u5230365\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u4ece1\u523034\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u4ece1\u52309\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c45%\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u5f0f\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0427\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u62a5\u544a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bba\u6587\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u9879\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u8bba\u6587\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u7528\u8bed\u548c\u7591\u4f3c\u9020\u5047\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

We investigate this question in SeamlessM4T v2 through three complementary analyses that probe where language and modality information is encoded, how selective neurons causally influence decoding, and how concentrated this influence is across the network. We identify language- and modality-selective neurons using average-precision ranking, investigate their functional role via median-replacement interventions at inference time, and analyze activation-magnitude inequality across languages and modalities. Across experiments, we find evidence of incomplete modality invariance. Although encoder representations become increasingly language-agnostic, this compression makes it more difficult for the shared decoder to recover the language of origin when constructing modality-agnostic representations, particularly when adapting from speech to text. We further observe sharply localized modality-selective structure in cross-attention key and value projections. Finally, speech-conditioned decoding and non-dominant scripts exhibit higher activation concentration, indicating heavier reliance on a small subset of neurons, which may underlie increased brittleness across modalities and languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9SeamlessM4T v2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53e3\u8bed\u4e0e\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u5e72\u9884\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5171\u4eab\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u811a\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\u8d8b\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5171\u4eab\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u811a\u672c\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f83\u91cd\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, progress in Multilingual Knowledge Editing (MKE) is currently hindered by biased evaluation frameworks. We observe that existing MKE benchmarks are typically constructed by mechanically translating English-centric datasets into target languages (e.g., English-to-Chinese). This approach introduces translation artifacts and neglects culturally specific entities native to the target language, failing to reflect the true knowledge distribution of LLMs. To address this, we propose CLM-Bench, a culture-aware benchmark constructed using a native Chinese-first methodology. We curate 1,010 high-quality CounterFact pairs rooted in Chinese cultural contexts and align them with English counterparts. Using CLM-Bench, we conduct extensive experiments on representative LLMs (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen2) and reveal a significant Cross-lingual Misalignment: edits in one language function independently and fail to propagate to the other. We further provide a geometric explanation via layer-wise representation analysis, demonstrating that edit vectors for Chinese and English are nearly orthogonal -- residing in disjoint subspaces -- while mixed-lingual editing exhibits linear additivity of these vectors. Our findings challenge the effectiveness of current methods in cross-lingual transfer and underscore the importance of culturally native benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u4e2d\u6587\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6CLM-Bench\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u539f\u751f\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u68b0\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6709\u6587\u5316\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLM-Bench\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c61010\u5bf9\u4e2d\u82f1\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CLM-Bench\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u9012\u81f3\u53e6\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u8f91\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u51e0\u4e4e\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u64ad\u3002"}}

While such frameworks provide a wide range of features, developers may leverage only a subset of them, while missing some highly desired features. This paper investigates the practical use and desired feature enhancements of eight popular open-source MLOps frameworks. Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features. The mapping with feature requests highlights that users mainly ask for enhancements to core features of the frameworks, but also better API exposure and CI/CD integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4e2d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e60\u60ef\u548c\u7528\u6237\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8eAPI\u5b9a\u5236\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u6539\u8fdb\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5229\u7528\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u4f46\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u6e90MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176API\u548c\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u5f88\u5c11\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5e38\u96c6\u6210\u5230GitHub\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u66f4\u591a\u901a\u8fc7API\u5b9e\u73b0\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u7528\u6237\u4e3b\u8981\u8bf7\u6c42\u589e\u5f3a\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8API\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684CI/CD\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "MLOps\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdbAPI\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548cCI/CD\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u9879\u76ee\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u751f\u6001\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

However, systematic analyses of how such signals vary across training strategies and model scales remain lacking. In this paper, we analyze token-level signals through token probabilities across various models.

In this work, we introduce a clustering-based memory compression strategy that balances context efficiency and personalization quality. Our method groups memories by similarity and merges them within clusters prior to concatenation, thereby preserving coherence while reducing redundancy.

However, existing detection methods struggle with two core limitations: (1) modality fragmentation, which leads to poor generalization across diverse and adversarial deepfake modalities; and (2) shallow inter-modal reasoning, resulting in limited detection of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. To address these, we propose ConLLM (Contrastive Learning with Large Language Models), a hybrid framework for robust multimodal deepfake detection. ConLLM employs a two-stage architecture: stage 1 uses Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to extract modality-specific embeddings; stage 2 aligns these embeddings via contrastive learning to mitigate modality fragmentation, and refines them using LLM-based reasoning to address shallow inter-modal reasoning by capturing semantic inconsistencies. ConLLM demonstrates strong performance across audio, video, and audio-visual modalities. It reduces audio deepfake EER by up to 50%, improves video accuracy by up to 8%, and achieves approximately 9% accuracy gains in audio-visual tasks.

We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \\textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IGP\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bc1\u636e\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7b97\u5185\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6bb5\u843d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982NDCG\uff09\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u591a\u6bb5\u843d\u6ce8\u5165\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8f7b\u5fae\u51b2\u7a81\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u6bb5\u843d\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u5f31\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u526a\u679d\uff08Information Gain Pruning, IGP\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f31\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u7b97\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\uff0cIGP\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5728\u591a\u8bc1\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cIGP\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612-20%\u7684\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8676-79%\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "IGP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6bb5\u843d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art solutions are based on retrieval augmentation, where relevant context from a user profile is retrieved for LLM consumption. These methods deal with a trade-off between exposing retrieved private data to cloud providers and relying on less capable local models. We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context. Additionally, the framework is efficient for edge deployment, with the client-side model generating only $9.2%$ of the total tokens. These results demonstrate that $P^3$ provides a practical, effective solution for personalized generation with improved privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86$P^3$\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u66b4\u9732\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u66b4\u9732\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u8349\u7a3f\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u79c1\u6709\u8d44\u6599\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5e76\u4fee\u6539\u8349\u7a3f\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fed\u4ee3\u76f4\u5230\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728LaMP-QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c$P^3$\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477.4%-9%\uff0c\u6062\u590d90.3%-95.7%\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0a\u9650\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u4ec5\u589e\u52a01.5%-3.5%\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ec5\u751f\u62109.2%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "$P^3$\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6cc4\u9732\u5168\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In contrast, sequence labeling (SL) tasks assign labels to each individual input token, naturally benefiting from bidirectional context. This discrepancy has historically led SL to rely on inherently bidirectional encoder-only models. However, the rapid development of decoder-only models has raised the question of whether they can be adapted to SL. While causal mask removal has emerged as a viable technique for adapting decoder-only models to leverage the full context for SL, it requires considerable changes to the base model functionality. In this work, we explore sequence repetition (SR) as a less invasive alternative for enabling bidirectionality in decoder-only models. Through fine-tuning experiments, we show that SR inherently makes decoders bidirectional, improving the quality of token-level embeddings and surpassing encoders and unmasked decoders. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that increasing the number of repetitions does not degrade SL performance. Finally, we demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers are highly effective for SR, comparable to those from final layers, while being significantly more efficient to compute. Our findings underscore that SR alleviates the structural limitations of decoders, enabling more efficient and adaptable LMs and broadening their applicability to other token-level tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ec5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u7136\u9700\u8981\u53cc\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5c4f\u853d\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u52a8\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u590d(SR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u5e45\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSR\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u53cc\u5411\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Token\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u672a\u5c4f\u853d\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u6b21\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u590d\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u53ea\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u591aToken\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While much prior work treats reasoning as a linear chain of steps, many reasoning problems are more naturally structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where intermediate conclusions may depend on multiple premises, branch into parallel sub-derivations, and later merge or be reused. Understanding whether such graph-structured reasoning is reflected in model internals remains an open question.\n  In this work, we introduce Reasoning DAG Probing, a framework that directly asks whether LLM hidden states encode the geometry of a reasoning DAG in a linearly accessible form, and where this structure emerges across layers. Within this framework, we associate each reasoning node with a textual realization and train lightweight probes to predict two graph-theoretic properties from hidden states: node depth and pairwise node distance. We use these probes to analyze the layerwise emergence of DAG structure and evaluate controls that disrupt reasoning-relevant structure while preserving superficial textual properties. Our results provide evidence that reasoning DAG geometry is meaningfully encoded in intermediate layers, with recoverability varying systematically by node depth and model scale, suggesting that LLM reasoning is not only sequential but exhibits measurable internal graph structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684DAG\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\u94fe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\u518d\u6c47\u5408\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u662f\u5426\u53cd\u6620\u8fd9\u79cd\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReasoning DAG Probing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u56fe\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e2dDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u63a8\u7406DAG\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u663e\u8457\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ebf\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\u94fe\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Large language models contain extensive knowledge from years of research across these domains. We propose LoID (Logit-Informed Distributions), a deterministic method for extracting informative prior distributions for Bayesian logistic regression by directly accessing their token-level predictions. Rather than relying on generated text, we probe the model's confidence in opposing semantic directions (positive vs. negative impact) through carefully constructed sentences. By measuring how consistently the LLM favors one direction across diverse phrasings, we extract the strength and reliability of the model's belief about each feature's influence. We evaluate LoID on ten real-world tabular datasets under synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) settings characterized by covariate shift, where the training data represents only a subset of the population. We compare our approach against (1) standard uninformative priors, (2) AutoElicit, a recent method that prompts LLMs to generate priors via text completions, (3) LLMProcesses, a method that uses LLMs to generate numerical predictions through in-context learning and (4) an oracle-style upper bound derived from fitting logistic regression on the full dataset. We assess performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Across datasets, LoID significantly improves performance over logistic regression trained on OOD data, recovering up to \\textbf{59\\%} of the performance gap relative to the oracle model.

Beyond this public impact lies a deeply personal toll on the friends and families of conspiracy believers, a dimension often overlooked in large-scale computational research. This study fills this gap by systematically mapping radicalization journeys and quantifying the associated emotional toll inflicted on loved ones. We use the prominent case of QAnon as a case study, analyzing 12747 narratives from the r/QAnonCasualties support community through a novel mixed-methods approach. First, we use topic modeling (BERTopic) to map the radicalization trajectories, identifying key pre-existing conditions, triggers, and post-radicalization characteristics. From this, we apply an LDA-based graphical model to uncover six recurring archetypes of QAnon adherents, which we term \"radicalization personas.\" Finally, using LLM-assisted emotion detection and regression modeling, we link these personas to the specific emotional toll reported by narrators. Our findings reveal that these personas are not just descriptive; they are powerful predictors of the specific emotional harms experienced by narrators. Radicalization perceived as a deliberate ideological choice is associated with narrator anger and disgust, while those marked by personal and cognitive collapse are linked to fear and sadness. This work provides the first empirical framework for understanding radicalization as a relational phenomenon, offering a vital roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate its interpersonal fallout.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790QAnon\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u768412747\u4e2a\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u7ed8\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u4eb2\u5c5e\u9020\u6210\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u53d9\u8ff0\u8005\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u5bb6\u5ead\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3\u5c1a\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528BERTopic\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u63cf\u7ed8\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLDA\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b6\u79cd\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u4eba\u683c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa6\u79cd\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u4eba\u683c\uff0c\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3\uff08\u6124\u6012\u3001\u538c\u6076\u3001\u6050\u60e7\u3001\u60b2\u4f24\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4eb2\u5c5e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5d29\u6e83\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address this, we present Pivot-Aligned Self-Feedback Multilingual Reasoning (PASMR), aiming to improve the alignment of multilingual math reasoning abilities in LLMs. This approach designates the model's primary language as the pivot language. During training, the model first translates questions into the pivot language to facilitate better alignment of reasoning patterns. The reasoning process in the target language is then supervised by the pivot language's reasoning answers, thereby establishing a cross-lingual self-feedback mechanism without relying on external correct answers or reward models.

This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.\n  At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings.

In this paper, we introduce the distance-to-distance ratio (DDR), a novel measure of similarity between LLM sentence embeddings. Inspired by Lipschitz continuity, DDR measures the rate of change in similarity between the pre-context word embeddings and the similarity between post-context LLM embeddings, thus measuring the semantic influence of context. We evaluate the performance of DDR in experiments designed as a series of perturbations applied to sentences drawn from a sentence dataset. For each sentence, we generate variants by replacing one, two, or three words with either synonyms, which constitute semantically similar text, or randomly chosen words, which constitute semantically dissimilar text. We compare the performance of DDR with other prevailing similarity metrics and demonstrate that DDR consistently provides finer discrimination between semantically similar and dissimilar texts, even under minimal, controlled edits.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6587\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u672a\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86DDR\uff08distance-to-distance ratio\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5355\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f3\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bcd\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cDDR\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u548c\u975e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e3b\u6d41\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DDR\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

This kind of indirect visual reference, known as visual metonymy, invites viewers to recover a target concept via associated cues rather than explicit depiction. In this work, we present the first computational investigation of visual metonymy. We introduce a novel pipeline grounded in semiotic theory that leverages large language models and text-to-image models to generate metonymic visual representations. Using this framework, we construct ViMET, the first visual metonymy dataset comprising 2,000 multiple-choice questions to evaluate the cognitive reasoning abilities in multimodal language models. Experimental results on our dataset reveal a significant gap between human performance (86.9%) and state-of-the-art vision-language models (65.9%), highlighting limitations in machines' ability to interpret indirect visual references.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) exhibit limited inherent moral reasoning, leading to calls for explicit moral teaching. However, constructing ground truth data for moral evaluation is difficult given plural frameworks and pervasive biases. We investigate unsupervised elicitation as an alternative, asking whether pretrained (base) LMs possess intrinsic moral reasoning capability that can be surfaced without human supervision. Using the Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) algorithm across three benchmark datasets and four LMs, we test whether ICM can reliably label moral judgments, generalize across moral frameworks, and mitigate social bias. Results show that ICM outperforms all pre-trained and chatbot baselines on the Norm Bank and ETHICS benchmarks, while fine-tuning on ICM labels performs on par with or surpasses those of human labels. Across theoretically motivated moral frameworks, ICM yields its largest relative gains on Justice and Commonsense morality. Furthermore, although chatbot LMs exhibit social bias failure rates comparable to their pretrained ones, ICM reduces such errors by more than half, with the largest improvements in race, socioeconomic status, and politics. These findings suggest that pretrained LMs possess latent moral reasoning capacities that can be elicited through unsupervised methods like ICM, providing a scalable path for AI alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6784\u5efa\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6fc0\u53d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08ICM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u9053\u5fb7\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "ICM\u5728Norm Bank\u548cETHICS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eICM\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u4e49\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u9053\u5fb7\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff1bICM\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u793e\u4ea4\u504f\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u534a\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u5584\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u5177\u5907\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08ICM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

To address this methodological gap, we present Hylog, a novel hybrid logging system that combines analytical keylogging with ecological text logging for a more complete and finer-grained analysis. Our modular, open-source system uses plug-ins for standard applications (Microsoft Word, Google Chrome) to capture both keyboard output and rendered text, which a hybridizer module then synchronizes into a dual trace. To validate the system's technical feasibility and demonstrate its analytical capabilities, we conducted a proof-of-concept study where two volunteers translated a text into simplified Chinese.

It enables large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning beyond text-chunk retrieval. Recent works have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to train agentic GraphRAG frameworks that perform iterative interactions between LLMs and knowledge graphs. However, existing RL-based frameworks such as Graph-R1 suffer from two key limitations: (1) they primarily depend on semantic similarity for retrieval, often overlooking the underlying graph structure, and (2) they rely on sparse, outcome-level rewards, failing to capture the quality of intermediate retrieval steps and their dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose ProGraph-R1, a progress-aware agentic framework for graph-based retrieval and multi-step reasoning. ProGraph-R1 introduces a structure-aware hypergraph retrieval mechanism that jointly considers semantic relevance and graph connectivity, encouraging coherent traversal along multi-hop reasoning paths. We also design a progress-based step-wise policy optimization, which provides dense learning signals by modulating advantages according to intermediate reasoning progress within a graph, rather than relying solely on final outcomes. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that ProGraph-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality over existing GraphRAG methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProGraph-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8fdb\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86GraphRAG\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684GraphRAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\u6b65\u9aa4\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProGraph-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u904d\u5386\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "ProGraph-R1\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GraphRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\uff0cProGraph-R1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Although current research mostly emphasizes English, the linguistic and cultural biases inherent in Global South languages, like Bengali, are little examined. This research seeks to examine the characteristics and magnitude of gender bias in Bengali, evaluating the efficacy of current approaches in identifying and alleviating bias. We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages.

However, conflicting objectives across heterogeneous SFT tasks often induce the \"seesaw effect\": optimizing for one task may degrade performance on others, particularly when model parameters are updated indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages.

While two-step \"embedding-detector\" TAD methods have shown state-of-the-art performance, their effectiveness is often limited by the use of a single embedding model and the lack of adaptability across diverse datasets and anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit the embeddings from multiple pretrained language models and integrate them into $MCA^2$, a multi-view TAD framework. $MCA^2$ adopts a multi-view reconstruction model to effectively extract normal textual patterns from multiple embedding perspectives. To exploit inter-view complementarity, a contrastive collaboration module is designed to leverage and strengthen the interactions across different views. Moreover, an adaptive allocation module is developed to automatically assign the contribution weight of each view, thereby improving the adaptability to diverse datasets.

A major challenge for this task is obtaining high quality diverse data for training. Prior work emphasizes diversity in functions, invocation patterns, and interaction turns, yet linguistic diversity of requests and coverage of arguments (e.g., \\texttt{city\\_name}, \\texttt{stock\\_ticker}) remain underexplored. We propose a method that generates synthetic datasets via optimizing general-purpose diversity metrics across both queries and arguments, without relying on hand-crafted rules or taxonomies, making it robust to different usecases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique via both intrinsic and extrinsic testing, comparing it to SoTA data generation methods.

However, existing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based approaches predominantly favor a \"top-down\" rational restructuring, often neglecting clients' embodied experiences and primary emotion processing. To address this, we propose an Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT)-based Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought framework (EFT-CoT). Adopting a \"bottom-up\" trajectory, it deconstructs the intervention into a three-stage reasoning flow: \"Embodied Perception - Cognitive Exploration - Narrative Intervention.\" Utilizing eight specialized agents, the system explicitly executes critical components such as somatic awareness mapping, adaptive assessment, core belief extraction, and narrative restructuring. We further constructed \"EFT-Instruct,\" a high-quality dataset via Chain-of-Thought distillation of approximately 67,000 authentic texts, and fine-tuned a specialized model, EFT-LLM. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that EFT-LLM outperforms strong baselines and human responses across metrics like empathy depth and structural professionalism.

Accepted by WWW'26", "summary": "The predictive probability of the next token (P_token) in large language models (LLMs) is inextricably linked to the probability of relevance for the next piece of information, the purchase probability of the next product, and the execution probability of the next action-all of which fall under the scope of the task-level target distribution (P_task). While LLMs are known to generate samples that approximate real-world distributions, whether their fine-grained sampling probabilities faithfully align with task requirements remains an open question. Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task. We further evaluate these two model types in downstream tasks such as code generation and recommendation, revealing systematic trade-offs between diversity and stability that shape task outcomes. Finally, we analyze the internal properties of both model families to probe their underlying mechanisms. These findings offer foundational insights into the probabilistic sampling behavior of LLMs and provide practical guidance on when to favor D- versus E-models.

When handling such complex tasks, existing agents manage context at the subtask level to overcome linear context accumulation and information loss. However, they still adhere to a single context window and sequential execution paradigm, which results in mutual interference and blocking behavior, restricting scalability and adaptability. To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics.

Through experiments across eight LLMs of varying scales and four standard NER datasets, we find that: (1) With parameter-efficient fine-tuning and structured formats like inline bracketed or XML, open-source LLMs achieve performance competitive with traditional encoder-based models and surpass closed-source LLMs like GPT-3; (2) The NER capability of LLMs stems from instruction-following and generative power, not mere memorization of entity-label pairs; and (3) Applying NER instruction tuning has minimal impact on general capabilities of LLMs, even improving performance on datasets like DROP due to enhanced entity understanding.

The vanilla LoRA is implemented with uniform ranks, and the recent literature have found that properly allocating ranks on the LLM backbones results in performance boosts. However, the previous rank allocation methods have limitations since they rely on inexplanable and unreliable importance measures for the LoRA ranks. To address the above issues, we propose the ShapLoRA framework. Inspired by the explanable attribution measure Shapley Value, we combine the sensitivity-based measures with the idea of coalitions in the collaborative games among LoRA ranks, and propose a more explainable importance measure called Shapley sensitivity. In addition, we optimize the workflow of the existing works by: (a) calculating Shapley sensitivity on a separate validation set; (b) Setting up the allocating-retraining procedures for fair comparisons. We have conducted experiments on various challenging tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ShapLoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u79e9\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6ShapLoRA\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03LoRA\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLoRA\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u79e9\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u79e9\u5206\u914d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u79e9\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShapLoRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u6807Shapley\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97Shapley\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5206\u914d-\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cShapLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "ShapLoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6d4b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LoRA\u79e9\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u5e94\u7528"}}

By constructing a monosemantic embedding space at the level of an LLM layer and optimizing the framework to explicitly reduce inter-method variability, our approach produces stable input-level importance scores and highlights salient features via a decompressed representation of the layer of interest, advancing the safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in cognitive health and neurodegenerative disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5355\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b49\u8ba4\u77e5\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u4eae\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5f52\u56e0\u6027\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Yet this knowledge remains mostly implicit and unstructured, limiting its interpretability and use. We present an iterative, prompt-based framework for constructing a Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Graph (CCKG) that treats LLMs as cultural archives, systematically eliciting culture-specific entities, relations, and practices and composing them into multi-step inferential chains across languages. We evaluate CCKG on five countries with human judgments of cultural relevance, correctness, and path coherence. We find that the cultural knowledge graphs are better realized in English, even when the target culture is non-English (e.g., Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic), indicating uneven cultural encoding in current LLMs. Augmenting smaller LLMs with CCKG improves performance on cultural reasoning and story generation, with the largest gains from English chains.

This diversity reward is combined with outcome correctness and solution efficiency in a z-score-normalized multi-objective objective that stabilizes training. On GSM8K, SD-E$^2$ surpasses the base Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and strong GRPO baselines (GRPO-CFL and GRPO-CFEE) by +27.4, +5.2, and +1.5 percentage points, respectively, while discovering on average 9.8 semantically distinct strategies per question. We further improve MedMCQA to 49.64% versus 38.37% for the base model and show gains on the harder AIME benchmark (1983-2025), reaching 13.28% versus 6.74% for the base.

Given a source segment and two candidate translations, PEAR predicts the direction and magnitude of their quality difference. The metrics are trained using pairwise supervision derived from differences in human judgments, with an additional regularization term that encourages sign inversion under candidate order reversal. On the WMT24 meta-evaluation benchmark, PEAR outperforms strictly matched single-candidate QE baselines trained with the same data and backbones, isolating the benefit of the proposed pairwise formulation. Despite using substantially fewer parameters than recent large metrics, PEAR surpasses far larger QE models and reference-based metrics. Our analysis further indicates that PEAR yields a less redundant evaluation signal relative to other top metrics.

However, LID models still perform poorly for many languages, especially on the noisy and heterogeneous web data often used to train multilingual language models. In this paper, we introduce CommonLID, a community-driven, human-annotated LID benchmark for the web domain, covering 109 languages. Many of the included languages have been previously under-served, making CommonLID a key resource for developing more representative high-quality text corpora. We show CommonLID's value by using it, alongside five other common evaluation sets, to test eight popular LID models. We analyse our results to situate our contribution and to provide an overview of the state of the art. In particular, we highlight that existing evaluations overestimate LID accuracy for many languages in the web domain.

Our experiments on multiple LLMs show that prepending random words/sentences unrelated to the prompt result in greater diversity in the outputs of LLMs. We believe that this promising result and the evaluation protocol opens up interesting avenues for future work, such as how infusing randomness into LLMs could be applied to other domains.

We argue that a recent neural model of language, ROSE, can offer a neurocomputational account of syntactic transfer in bilingual production, capturing some of its formal properties and the scope of morphosyntactic sequencing failure modes. We take as a case study cross-linguistic influence (CLI) and attendant theories of functional inhibition/competition, and present these as being driven by specific oscillatory failure modes during L2 sentence planning. We argue that modeling CLI in this way not only offers the kind of linking hypothesis ROSE was built to encourage, but also licenses the exploration of more spatiotemporally complex biomarkers of language dysfunction than more commonly discussed neural signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578bROSE\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u7684\u632f\u8361\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u8bed\u4ea7\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65bd\u5c42\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u53cc\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578bROSE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u632f\u8361\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u6a21\u62dfL2\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u529f\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u53cc\u8bed\u4ea7\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u4f4d\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u4e3a\u53cc\u8bed\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578bROSE\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u8bed\u4ea7\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f62\u6001\u53e5\u6cd5\u5e8f\u5217\u5931\u6548\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff08CLI\uff09\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u6291\u5236/\u7ade\u4e89\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u53d7L2\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ROSE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408ROSE\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We study this question with a controlled comparison between matched Llama text backbones and their Llama Vision counterparts across multiple model scales, treating multimodal pretraining as an ablation on perceptual grounding rather than access to images at inference. We measure concreteness effects at three complementary levels: (i) output behavior, by relating question-level concreteness to QA accuracy; (ii) embedding geometry, by testing whether representations organize along a concreteness axis; and (iii) attention dynamics, by quantifying context reliance via attention-entropy measures. In addition, we elicit token-level concreteness ratings from models and evaluate alignment to human norm distributions, testing whether multimodal training yields more human-consistent judgments. Across benchmarks and scales, VLMs show larger gains on more concrete inputs, exhibit clearer concreteness-structured representations, produce ratings that better match human norms, and display systematically different attention patterns consistent with increased grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5339\u914d\u7684Llama\u6587\u672c\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u6cbf\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8bc4\u5206\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

The card game Hanabi embodies this challenge, requiring theory-of-mind reasoning and strategic communication. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLM agents in 2-5 player games and study the impact of context engineering across model scales (4B to 600B+) to understand persistent coordination failures and robustness to scaffolding: from a minimal prompt with only explicit card details (Watson setting), to scaffolding with programmatic, Bayesian-motivated deductions (Sherlock setting), to multi-turn state tracking via working memory (Mycroft setting). We show that (1) agents can maintain an internal working memory for state tracking and (2) cross-play performance between different LLMs smoothly interpolates with model strength. In the Sherlock setting, the strongest reasoning models exceed 15 points on average across player counts, yet still trail experienced humans and specialist Hanabi agents, both consistently scoring above 20. We release the first public Hanabi datasets with annotated trajectories and move utilities: (1) HanabiLogs, containing 1,520 full game logs for instruction tuning, and (2) HanabiRewards, containing 560 games with dense move-level value annotations for all candidate moves. Supervised and RL finetuning of a 4B open-weight model (Qwen3-Instruct) on our datasets improves cooperative Hanabi play by 21% and 156% respectively, bringing performance to within ~3 points of a strong proprietary reasoning model (o4-mini) and surpassing the best non-reasoning model (GPT-4.1) by 52%. The HanabiRewards RL-finetuned model further generalizes beyond Hanabi, improving performance on a cooperative group-guessing benchmark by 11%, temporal reasoning on EventQA by 6.4%, instruction-following on IFBench-800K by 1.7 Pass@10, and matching AIME 2025 mathematical reasoning Pass@10.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9Hanabi\u6e38\u620f\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Hanabi\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u7b80\u6d01\u5361\u724c\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd517\u79cdLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u5e26\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf94B\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e8617\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u4ebaHanabi\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5361\u724c\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7ef4\u62a4\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b8c\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u6700\u590d\u6742\u7684Sherlock\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u8d85\u8fc715\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ca\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Hanabi\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u6ce8\u91ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08HanabiLogs\u548cHanabiRewards\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a4B\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe156%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f3a\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u52a9\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5f31\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u4ee3\u7406\u3002"}}

We introduce CHiRPE (Clinical High-Risk Prediction with Explainability), an NLP pipeline that takes transcribed semi-structured clinical interviews to: (i) predict psychosis risk; and (ii) generate novel SHAP explanation formats co-developed with clinicians. Trained on 944 semi-structured interview transcripts across 24 international clinics of the AMP-SCZ study, the CHiRPE pipeline integrates symptom-domain mapping, LLM summarisation, and BERT classification. CHiRPE achieved over 90% accuracy across three BERT variants and outperformed baseline models. Explanation formats were evaluated by 28 clinical experts who indicated a strong preference for our novel concept-guided explanations, especially hybrid graph-and-text summary formats. CHiRPE demonstrates that clinically-guided model development produces both accurate and interpretable results. Our next step is focused on real-world testing across our 24 international sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "CHiRPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4bNLP\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5f0f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u533b\u751f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86NLP\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e944\u4efd\u8de824\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u8bca\u6240\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbf\u8c08\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u75c7\u72b6\u9886\u57df\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6458\u8981\u548cBERT\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CHiRPE\u81ea\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u751f\u6210SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u7684NLP\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "CHiRPE\u5728\u4e09\u79cdBERT\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b28\u4f4d\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u504f\u597d\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u6587\u6458\u8981\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "CHiRPE\u7ba1\u9053\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5bf9NLP\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Code is publicly available at https://github.com/scb-10x/typhoon-s . Datasets and model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/typhoon-ai/typhoon-s", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTyphoon S\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u65b9\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u901a\u7528\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6cf0\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u672c\u571f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5730\u65b9\u6216\u4e3b\u6743\u673a\u6784\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u9700\u900f\u660e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u4e3b\u6743\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55GRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u6cf0\u8bed\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cf0\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5730\u65b9\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Typhoon S\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5730\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5730\u533a\u4e13\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u6743\u7ea7\u522b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Experiments follow the official train/validation/test split, and imbalance is mitigated using inverse-frequency class weights. Across several metrics, namely Micro-F1, Macro-F1, Hamming Loss, and Subset Accuracy, we observe that logistic regression attains the highest Micro-F1 of 0.51, while BERT achieves the best overall balance surpassing the official paper's reported results, reaching Macro-F1 0.49, Hamming Loss 0.036, and Subset Accuracy 0.36.

Existing approaches largely rely on unstructured retrieval or coarse abstractions, which often lead to temporal conflicts, brittle reasoning, and limited traceability. We propose MemWeaver, a unified memory framework that consolidates long-term agent experiences into three interconnected components: a temporally grounded graph memory for structured relational reasoning, an experience memory that abstracts recurring interaction patterns from repeated observations, and a passage memory that preserves original textual evidence. MemWeaver employs a dual-channel retrieval strategy that jointly retrieves structured knowledge and supporting evidence to construct compact yet information-dense contexts for reasoning.

Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models. On real-world images, human evaluation reveals that we achieve minimum compilation errors across all baselines in 7 out of 8 diagram types and improve the average F1 score of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 6.97x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u624b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u624b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u56fe\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u7ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6545\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u624b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03Llama 3.2 11B-instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210LLama-VL-TUG\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u624b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86Llama 3.2 11B-instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230LLama-VL-TUG\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728ROUGE-L\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.14\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u7ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e867\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d7\u79cd\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53476.97\u500d\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLama-VL-TUG\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u7ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However, current approaches largely depend on rigid supervised signals, such as ground-truth response in supervised fine-tuning or preference scores in reinforcement learning. Such reliance is fundamentally limited for modeling complex empathy, as there is no single \"correct\" response and a simple numerical score cannot fully capture the nuances of emotional expression or the appropriateness of empathetic behavior. To address these limitations, we sequentially introduce EmpathyEval, a descriptive natural-language-based evaluation model for assessing empathetic quality in spoken dialogues. Building upon EmpathyEval, we propose ReEmpathy, an end-to-end SLM that enhances empathetic dialogue through a novel Empathetic Self-Reflective Alternating Inference mechanism, which interleaves spoken response generation with free-form, empathy-related reflective reasoning.

Existing context-folding methods mitigate this issue by summarizing past interactions, yet they are typically designed for single-query or single-intent scenarios. In more realistic user-centric dialogues, we identify two major failure modes: (i) they irreversibly discard fine-grained constraints and intermediate facts that are crucial for later decisions, and (ii) their summaries fail to track evolving user intent, leading to omissions and erroneous actions. To address these limitations, we propose U-Fold, a dynamic context-folding framework tailored to user-centric tasks. U-Fold retains the full user--agent dialogue and tool-call history but, at each turn, uses two core components to produce an intent-aware, evolving dialogue summary and a compact, task-relevant tool log. Extensive experiments on $\u03c4$-bench, $\u03c4^2$-bench, VitaBench, and harder context-inflated settings show that U-Fold consistently outperforms ReAct (achieving a 71.4% win rate in long-context settings) and prior folding baselines (with improvements of up to 27.0%), particularly on long, noisy, multi-turn tasks. Our study demonstrates that U-Fold is a promising step toward transferring context-management techniques from single-query benchmarks to realistic user-centric applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aU-Fold\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6298\u53e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6298\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u7eed\u51b3\u7b56\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6298\u53e0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "U-Fold\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6458\u8981\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "U-Fold\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eReAct\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6298\u53e0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d62\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe71.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "U-Fold\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

Existing methods rely on fixed workflows and expensive closed-source APIs, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose Temp-R1, the first autonomous end-to-end agent for TKGQA trained through reinforcement learning. To address cognitive overload in single-action reasoning, we expand the action space with specialized internal actions alongside external action. To prevent shortcut learning on simple questions, we introduce reverse curriculum learning that trains on difficult questions first, forcing the development of sophisticated reasoning before transferring to easier cases. Our 8B-parameter Temp-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA, improving 19.8% over strong baselines on complex questions.

Many recent pre-trained models have been reported to exhibit only slight changes in the angular distance between the input and output hidden state vectors in the middle Transformer layers, despite a disproportionately large ``jump'' in the angular distance occurring in or around the final Transformer layer. To characterize this, we first introduce a quantitative metric for the jump strength around the final layer, and then demonstrate its prevalence across many open-weight models, as well as its amplification throughout pre-training. Assuming such jumps indicate an undesirable property, we propose the jump-suppressing regularizer (JREG) which penalizes this jump during pre-training, thereby encouraging more balanced capability usage across the middle layers. Empirical evaluations of three model sizes of Llama-based models, trained with the proposed JREG method, reveal improved task performance compared to the baseline without altering the model architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u89d2\u8ddd\u79bb\u8df3\u8dc3\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8df3\u8dc3\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f88\u591a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u89d2\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u8df3\u8dc3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8df3\u8dc3\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff08JREG\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u60e9\u7f5a\u8be5\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eLlama\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528JREG\u540e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment.

Current systems exhibit fundamental limitations: single-modality input, one-shot generation, and rigid workflows. While LLM-based approaches show potential for these complex requirements, they introduce reliability challenges including catastrophic failures and infinite loop susceptibility. To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our logic rules are mathematical constraints that guide LLM reasoning rather than replacing it. We formalize the MultiVis task spanning four scenarios from basic generation to iterative refinement, and develop MultiVis-Bench, a benchmark with over 1,000 cases for multi-modal visualization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 75.63% visualization score on challenging tasks, significantly outperforming baselines (57.54-62.79%), with task completion rates of 99.58% and code execution success rates of 94.56% (vs. 74.48% and 65.10% without logic rules), successfully addressing both complexity and reliability challenges in automated visualization generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiVis-Agent\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u56db\u5c42\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0eMultiVis-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMultiVis-Agent\u8fbe\u621075.63%\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u738799.58%\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u738794.56%\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiVis-Agent\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u5c42\u6570\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We present a case study for adapter interference in safety-critical domains using a 14B-parameter base model through a two-stage LoRA pipeline: (1) domain-adaptive pre-training (PT) to inject broad medical knowledge via continued pre-training (DAPT), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model with medical question-answering behaviors through instruction-style data. To balance instruction-following ability and domain knowledge retention, we propose Weighted Adapter Merging, linearly combining SFT and PT adapters before exporting a merged base-model checkpoint. On a held-out medical validation set (F5/F6), the merged model achieves BLEU-4 = 16.38, ROUGE-1 = 20.42, ROUGE-2 = 4.60, and ROUGE-L = 11.54 under a practical decoding configuration.

We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting \"Lava is Safe\"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6291\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u60ef\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Code-Grounded Vistas\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u98a0\u8986\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f18\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u770b\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u2018\u7194\u5ca9\u662f\u5371\u9669\u7684\u2019\uff09\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u60ef\u6027\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5373\u65e0\u6cd5\u6291\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6291\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5173\u8054\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u7269\u7406\u6cd5\u5219\u7684\u6e38\u620fBaba Is You\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u53d8\u66f4\u65f6\u8986\u76d6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u800c\u975e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Fine-tune\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u542b\u77db\u76fe\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCode-Grounded Vistas (LCV)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6291\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5173\u8054\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u9006\u5411\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cLCV\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u201c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u662f\u66f4\u4f18\u201d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u5b66\u4e60\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, many real-world taxonomies introduce ambiguities, such as identical leaf names under similar parent nodes, which prevent language models (LMs) from learning clear decision boundaries. In this paper, we present TaxMorph, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform entire taxonomies through operations such as renaming, merging, splitting, and reordering. Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases.

Ph.D. Thesis. The University of Sheffield", "summary": "With natural language processing (NLP), researchers aim to enable computers to identify and understand patterns in human languages. This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.\n  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f0a\u535a\u8bed\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8en-gram\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u91cd\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dNLP\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f0a\u535a\u8bed\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cd\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6807\u51c6n-gram\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u524d\u7684\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u4e24\u4fa7\u7684\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7a97\u53e3\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5019\u9009\u53d8\u4f53\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f0a\u535a\u8bed\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08n-gram\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4f0a\u535a\u8bed\u7684\u91cd\u97f3\u7b26\u53f7\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Standard practices include prompting decoder-only LLMs using greedy decoding to avoid output variability. Rather than treating this variability as a limitation, we show that sampling can produce substantially better solutions than greedy decoding, especially when using reasoning models. We thus propose ThinkTwice, a sampling and selection framework in which the LLM generates multiple candidate templates for a given document, and a selection module chooses the most suitable one. We introduce both an unsupervised method that exploits agreement across generated outputs, and a supervised selection method using reward models trained on labeled DocIE data. To address the scarcity of golden reasoning trajectories for DocIE, we propose a rejection-sampling-based method to generate silver training data that pairs output templates with reasoning traces.

The architecture comprises primary recognition using Wav2Vec2, false positive filtering via the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and final speech recognition through Whisper. The implementation of curriculum learning methods and the utilization of diverse Russian-language speech corpora significantly enhanced the system's effectiveness. Additionally, advanced uncertainty modeling techniques were introduced, contributing to further improvements in transcription quality. The proposed approaches ensure robust transcribing of long audio data across various acoustic conditions compared to WhisperX and the usual Whisper model.

We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Llama 3.1 8B\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672c\u4f53\u672f\u8bed\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u540e\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.1 8B\u5fae\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60HPO\u548cGO\u672c\u4f53\u672f\u8bed\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Cox\u6bd4\u4f8b\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u5b9e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9000\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540eHPO\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5fc6\u7387\u4ece2.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f371.9%\uff1b\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a0\u901f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\uff08HR 2.6\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u672a\u89c1GO\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a5.8%\uff0c\u4f46\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u6982\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5f3a\u5316\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5df2\u5b66\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5df2\u5b66\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002"}}

Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u590d\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u5e7d\u9ed8\u6027\u3001\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\uff0c\u5982\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u4e0e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u53cc\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u590d\u5408\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u76f4\u89c2\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u4e00\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ebf\u7d22\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u591a\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u79cd\u65cf\u6216\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u540c\u4e00\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u6784\u5ff5\u6548\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u5efa\u8bae\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u7ebf\u7d22\u7f16\u7801\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7ebf\u7d22\u5373\u4fbf\u4ee3\u8868\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b\u540c\u4e00\u7ebf\u7d22\u5185\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u8f83\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6784\u5ff5\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6784\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u7247\u9762\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u751f\u6001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present SWITCH, the Social Work Interactive Training Chatbot. SWITCH integrates realistic client simulation, real-time counseling skill classification, and a Motivational Interviewing (MI) progression system into the training workflow. To model a client, SWITCH uses a cognitively grounded profile comprising static fields (e.g., background, beliefs) and dynamic fields (e.g., emotions, automatic thoughts, openness), allowing the agent's behavior to evolve throughout a session realistically. The skill classification module identifies the counseling skills from the user utterances, and feeds the result to the MI controller that regulates the MI stage transitions. To enhance classification accuracy, we study in-context learning with retrieval over annotated transcripts, and a fine-tuned BERT multi-label classifier. In the experiments, we demonstrated that both BERT-based approach and in-context learning outperforms the baseline with big margin.

However, it remains unclear whether fine-tuning strategies can improve long-context performance and translate to greater robustness under KV-cache compression techniques. In this work, we investigate which training strategies most effectively enhance LCLMs' ability to identify and use relevant information, as well as enhancing their robustness under KV-cache compression. Our experiments show substantial in-domain improvements, achieving gains of up to +20 points over the base model. However, out-of-domain generalization remains task dependent with large variance -- LCLMs excels on finance questions (+9 points), while RAG shows stronger performance on multiple-choice questions (+6 points) over the baseline models.

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) succeeds in reasoning tasks (e.g., math and code) by checking the final verifiable answer (i.e., a verifiable dot signal). However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment.

We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks.

This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity).

The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings.

However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \\textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \\textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \\textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \\textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \\textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations.

The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dep-Search\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "Dep-Search\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dep-Search\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Dep-Search\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior.

By constructing 'glottosets' from Wikipedia lexicons, we introduce a framework for simultaneous cross-linguistic comparison via Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). Our approach utilizes rank-based subword vectors to analyze vocabulary overlap, lexical divergence, and language similarity at scale. Evaluations demonstrate that BPE segmentation aligns with morpheme boundaries 95% better than random baseline across 15 languages (F1 = 0.34 vs 0.15). BPE vocabulary similarity correlates significantly with genetic language relatedness (Mantel r = 0.329, p < 0.001), with Romance languages forming the tightest cluster (mean distance 0.51) and cross-family pairs showing clear separation (0.82). Analysis of 26,939 cross-linguistic homographs reveals that 48.7% receive different segmentations across related languages, with variation correlating to phylogenetic distance. Our results provide quantitative macro-linguistic insights into lexical patterns across typologically diverse languages within a unified analytical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528BPE\u5b50\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9242\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ca\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWikipedia\u8bcd\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u201cglottosets\u201d\uff0c\u5229\u7528Byte-Pair Encoding\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u540d\u5b50\u8bcd\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u4f20\u5173\u7cfb\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u540c\u5f62\u5f02\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5dee\u5f02\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7BPE\u5b50\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9242\u79cd\u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u6bcd\u53ca\u897f\u91cc\u5c14\u5b57\u6bcd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5f62\u7d20\u8fb9\u754c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u7684BPE\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

However, methods for interpreting, exploring and reversing embedding spaces are limited, reducing transparency and precluding potentially valuable generative use cases. In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eELM\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u9006\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Embedding Language Model (ELM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684ELM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217ELM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578bctELM\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4ece\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ece\u65b0\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6458\u8981\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u516c\u5f00\u4e86ELM\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7ELM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
