Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFD-copilot\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5230\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5bfcCFD\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CFD\u4eff\u771f\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574CFD\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCFD-copilot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684CFD\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u6267\u884c\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728NACA 0012\u7ffc\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u5143\u7d2030P-30N\u7ffc\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u548cMCP\u6a21\u5757\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CFD-copilot\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684CFD\u4eff\u771f\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still face significant challenges in achieving high-fidelity document-to-codebase synthesis--such as scientific papers to code--primarily due to a fundamental conflict between information overload and the context bottlenecks of LLMs. In this work, we introduce DeepCode, a fully autonomous framework that fundamentally addresses this challenge through principled information-flow management. By treating repository synthesis as a channel optimization problem, DeepCode seamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression via blueprint distillation, structured indexing using stateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection via retrieval-augmented generation, and closed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics.

Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice. Together, these contributions advance the foundations for more maintainable and trustworthy ML systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eHuggingFace\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u9ad8\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08LESS\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eML\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceHuggingFace\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4ea4\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5361\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8de8\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4ea4\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u793e\u533a\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper presents a review of existing gray literature, examining fairness requirements in AI context, with a focus on how they are defined across various application domains, managed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and the causes, as well as the corresponding consequences of their violation by AI models. Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

To address this limitation, we propose CrowdLLM that integrates pretrained LLMs and generative models to enhance the diversity and fidelity of the digital population.

Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant.

This paper introduces MARINE (Multi-Agent Recursive IN-context Enhancement), a theoretically grounded framework that reconceptualizes test-time reasoning as iterative refinement of a persistent reference trajectory, fundamentally departing from conventional one-shot or multi-sample paradigms. The MARINE refinement operator systematically converts a base model's pass@N capabilities into near-optimal pass@1 performance. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes that minimal feasible batches maximize expected performance gains under fixed invocation budgets, while logarithmically growing batch schedules ensure continuous improvement without computational constraints. Comprehensive evaluation on the BrowserComp-ZH benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art results, with a 685B-parameter implementation achieving 46.0% pass@1 accuracy.

While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6316\u6398\u96be\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u8282\u7701\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff08bi-encoder\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6316\u6398\u96be\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u79cd\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u517121,800\u6761\u67e5\u8be2\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728MRR@5\u548cDCG@5\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534727.7%\u548c44.6%\uff0c\u5728FinanceBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76843\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2dNDCG\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u6599\u5229\u7528\u901a\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8627.7% MRR@5\u548c44.6% DCG@5\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u6807\u6ce8\u3002"}}

Investigating Package Hallucinations of Shell Command in Original and Quantized LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models for code (LLMs4Code) are increasingly used to generate software artifacts, including library and package recommendations in languages such as Go. However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies. Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210Go\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8b66\u60d5\u865a\u5047\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u865a\u5047\u5305\u540d\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9Go\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684Qwen\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u30018\u4f4d\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5305\u865a\u5047\u7387\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5305\u865a\u5047\u7387\uff0c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7387\u4e5f\u968f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u865a\u5047\u5305\u540d\u591a\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9eURL\u8def\u5f84\u7684GitHub\u6216golang.org\u4ed3\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u91cf\u5316LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u9700\u5ba1\u614e\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, the inherent uncertainty of aircraft trajectories and traffic flows poses significant challenges to both prediction accuracy and trustworthiness. Therefore, prediction models should not only provide point estimates of aircraft landing times but also the uncertainties associated with these predictions. Furthermore, aircraft trajectories are frequently influenced by the presence of nearby aircraft through air traffic control interventions such as radar vectoring. Consequently, landing time prediction models must account for multi-agent interactions in the airspace. In this work, we propose a probabilistic multi-agent aircraft landing time prediction framework that provides the landing times of multiple aircraft as distributions.

Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing.

This paper reports our experience converting the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) from Qiskit Algorithms with Qiskit 1.x (v1 primitives) to a custom implementation using Qiskit 2.x (v2 primitives). Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration. The library's implicit use of unlimited shots yielded dense probability distributions, whereas the v2 default of 10 000 shots captured only 23% of the state space. Increasing shots to 250 000 restored library-level accuracy.

Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable \"soft\" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference.

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data. Experimental results show that these models not only achieve significant token savings (up to 11.2% reduction) during generation but also maintain near-identical Pass@1 scores compared to baselines trained on unprocessed code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faToken Sugar\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7b80\u5199\u66ff\u6362\u5197\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5197\u957f\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7801token\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u505a\u8bed\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u6316\u6398\u9ad8\u9891\u3001token\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7b80\u5199\u5e76\u5728LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97799\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7b80\u5199\u5bf9\uff0c\u6e90\u7801token\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e15.1%\uff0c\u751f\u6210token\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u9ad811.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5728Pass@1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Token Sugar\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801token\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002"}}

Traditional cloud-based tools offer strong reasoning but risk data exposure and latency, while on-device solutions lack full-context understanding across codebase and developer tooling. We introduce SolidGPT, an open-source, edge-cloud hybrid developer assistant built on GitHub, designed to enhance code and workspace semantic search. SolidGPT enables developers to: talk to your codebase: interactively query code and project structure, discovering the right methods and modules without manual searching. Automate software project workflows: generate PRDs, task breakdowns, Kanban boards, and even scaffold web app beginnings, with deep integration via VSCode and Notion. Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension. In practice, SolidGPT empowers developer productivity through: Semantic-rich code navigation: no more hunting through files or wondering where a feature lives. Integrated documentation and task management: seamlessly sync generated PRD content and task boards into developer workflows. Privacy-first design: running locally via Docker or VSCode, with full control over code and data, while optionally reaching out to LLM APIs as needed. By combining interactive code querying, automated project scaffolding, and human-AI collaboration, SolidGPT provides a practical, privacy-respecting edge assistant that accelerates real-world development workflows, ideal for intelligent mobile and software engineering contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "SolidGPT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u6df7\u5408\u5f00\u53d1\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u89e3\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGitHub\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9879\u76ee\u6587\u6863\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u677f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u8c03\u7528LLM API\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9879\u76ee\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u969c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u79c1\u5bc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "SolidGPT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals.

Contrastive Explanations Inform Gender Choices by Translation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Interpretability can be implemented as a means to understand decisions taken by (black box) models, such as machine translation (MT) or large language models (LLMs). Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation.

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u5e74\u9f84\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5174\u8da3\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6559\u5b66\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ef\u5728\u665a\u671f\u589e\u5f3a\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u65e9\u671f\u66b4\u9732\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7406\u8bba\uff08POI\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e72\u9884\u524d\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u8fc7400\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u70ed\u60c5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u9752\u6625\u671f\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5973\u5b69\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5174\u8da3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u6027\u522b\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5e74\u957f\u5b66\u751f\u867d\u8d77\u59cb\u6001\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u5174\u8da3\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u665a\u671f\u5174\u8da3\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002"}}

(English translation assisted by GPT)", "summary": "Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u533f\u540d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u533f\u540d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bKanana-1.5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u97e9\u8bed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Kanana-1.5\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe\u523087.00%\uff0c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea63.89%\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5f53\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation.

Existing reviews in this domain either overlook some important tasks, such as synthetic data generation for addressing privacy concerns, or explainable clinical NLP for improved integration and implementation, or fail to mention important methodologies, including retrieval augmented generation and the neural symbolic integration of LLMs and KGs. In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields. The type of tutorial is \"Introductory to CL/NLP topics (HealthcareNLP)\" and the audience does not need prior knowledge to attend this.

Unlike existing tools that often focus primarily on internal server errors, RESTifAI systematically constructs valid test scenarios (happy paths) and derives negative cases to verify both intended functionality (2xx responses) and robustness against invalid inputs or business-rule violations (4xx responses). The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration.

Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness). Ablations revealed that MOSAIC outperforms baseline benchmarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ea4\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edfMOSAIC\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ea4\u6d41\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u60a3\u8005-\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLangGraph\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MOSAIC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "MOSAIC\u5728\u98ce\u6e7f\u75c5\u548c\u5987\u4ea7\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u603b\u4f53F1\u5f97\u52060.928\uff0c\u98ce\u6e7f\u75c5\u5b50\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08F1=0.962\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMOSAIC\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSAIC\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c outperform\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ea4\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6SimpleDevQA\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u83b7\u53d6\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u8bed\u79cd\u7684SimpleDevQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684SimpleDevQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b2740\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u4e2d\u6587\u548c\u4fc4\u8bed\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u8c03\u552f\u4e00\u3001\u7b80\u77ed\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u534711.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cSimpleDevQA\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged.

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores.

Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a \"posts -> user vector -> labels\" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset).", "AI": {"tldr": "ROME\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u5377\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u56de\u7b54\u5fc3\u7406\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u5e16\u5b50\u4e0e\u95ee\u5377\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u5377\u7b54\u6848\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u4eba\u683c\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ROME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u56de\u7b54\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cKaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u534715.41%\u3002", "conclusion": "ROME\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u957fTransformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u8def\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0Transformer\u5c42\u6570\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u7406\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u9010\u6e10\u4e2d\u95f4\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9MIDAS\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9010\u6e10\u4e2d\u95f4\u5806\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u7f6e\u6362\u8ba1\u7b97\u5757\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6\u975e\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRAGLens\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8LLM\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5747\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u5f15\u5165\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bbLLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668RAGLens\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "RAGLens\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u671f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728LLM\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "RAGLens\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522bRAG\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}
