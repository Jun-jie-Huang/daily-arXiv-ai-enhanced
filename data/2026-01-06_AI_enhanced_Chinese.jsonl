While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.\n  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.\n  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728AI\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd2\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u66b4\u9732\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u590d\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u591a\u6bd2\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u975e\u7531\u66b4\u9732\u76f4\u63a5\u8bf1\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9c9c\u6709\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u66b4\u9732\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7406\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5168AI\u4e92\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Chirper.ai\u4e0a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u96c6\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u548c\u8bc4\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u590d\u4e0e\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u66b4\u9732\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u590d\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8ddf\u968f\u6bd2\u6027\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u91cf\u6bd2\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u7d2f\u79ef\u66b4\u9732\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u590d\u6982\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd2\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66b4\u9732\u91cf\u662fLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u76d1\u6d4b\u6240\u63a5\u89e6\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u4ea7\u751f\u3002"}}

To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u5546\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u548c\u8f66\u4e3b\u7684\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u5145\u7535\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u5728\u8f66\u4e0e\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8f66\u4e3b\u5219\u8ffd\u6c42\u4fbf\u5229\u548c\u5145\u8db3\u7535\u91cf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u987e\u53cc\u65b9\u5229\u76ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u613f\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u534f\u5546\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u9f13\u52b1\u8f66\u4e3b\u5728\u79bb\u5f00\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5145\u7535\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u7ed9\u4e88\u9002\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u7814\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u975e\u534f\u5546\u5145\u7535\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc73.5%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5145\u7535\u8d39\u7528\u964d\u4f4e22%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u65b9\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e86\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd0\u8425\u8005\u4e0e\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7528\u6237\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5145\u7535\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u8fd0\u8425\u77db\u76fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u4e0e\u51fa\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6218\u7565\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

Manuscript submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication", "summary": "A central challenge in social science is to generate rich qualitative hypotheses about how diverse social groups might interpret new information. This article introduces and illustrates a novel methodological approach for this purpose: sociological persona simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which we frame as a \"qualitative laboratory\". We argue that for this specific task, persona simulation offers a distinct advantage over established methods. By generating naturalistic discourse, it overcomes the lack of discursive depth common in vignette surveys, and by operationalizing complex worldviews through natural language, it bypasses the formalization bottleneck of rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To demonstrate this potential, we present a protocol where personas derived from a sociological theory of climate reception react to policy messages.

Although code review serves as a critical defense mechanism against security flaws, relevant feedback remains scarce due to limited attention to security issues or a lack of expertise among reviewers. Existing datasets and studies primarily focus on general-purpose code review comments, either lacking security-specific annotations or being too limited in scale to support large-scale research. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{SeRe}, a \\textbf{security-related code review dataset}, constructed using an active learning-based ensemble classification approach. The proposed approach iteratively refines model predictions through human annotations, achieving high precision while maintaining reasonable recall. Using the fine-tuned ensemble classifier, we extracted 6,732 security-related reviews from 373,824 raw review instances, ensuring representativeness across multiple programming languages. Statistical analysis indicates that SeRe generally \\textbf{aligns with real-world security-related review distribution}. To assess both the utility of SeRe and the effectiveness of existing code review comment generation approaches, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches on security-related feedback generation.

This paper introduces a novel threat where colluding agents steer victim beliefs using only truthful evidence fragments distributed through public channels, without relying on covert communications, backdoors, or falsified documents. By exploiting LLMs' overthinking tendency, we formalize the first cognitive collusion attack and propose Generative Montage: a Writer-Editor-Director framework that constructs deceptive narratives through adversarial debate and coordinated posting of evidence fragments, causing victims to internalize and propagate fabricated conclusions. To study this risk, we develop CoPHEME, a dataset derived from real-world rumor events, and simulate attacks across diverse LLM families. Our results show pervasive vulnerability across 14 LLM families: attack success rates reach 74.4% for proprietary models and 70.6% for open-weights models. Counterintuitively, stronger reasoning capabilities increase susceptibility, with reasoning-specialized models showing higher attack success than base models or prompts. Furthermore, these false beliefs then cascade to downstream judges, achieving over 60% deception rates, highlighting a socio-technical vulnerability in how LLM-based agents interact with dynamic information environments.

We study compressed query delegation (CQD): (i) compress a high-dimensional latent reasoning state into a low-rank tensor query, (ii) delegate the minimal query to an external oracle, and (iii) update the latent state via Riemannian optimization on fixed-rank manifolds. We give a math-first formulation: CQD is a constrained stochastic program with a query-budget functional and an oracle modeled as a noisy operator. We connect CQD to classical rate-distortion and information bottleneck principles, showing that spectral hard-thresholding is optimal for a natural constrained quadratic distortion problem, and we derive convergence guarantees for Riemannian stochastic approximation under bounded oracle noise and smoothness assumptions. Empirically, we report (A) a 2,500-item bounded-context reasoning suite (BBH-derived tasks plus curated paradox instances) comparing CQD against chain-of-thought baselines under fixed compute and context; and (B) a human \"cognitive mirror\" benchmark (N=200) measuring epistemic gain and semantic drift across modern oracles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u67e5\u8be2\u59d4\u6258\uff08CQD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86 CQD \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u754c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u50a8\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u59d4\u6258\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u5316\u7684CQD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u79e9\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u5916\u90e8\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7b97\u5b50\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u786c\u9608\u503c\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u6b21\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b2500\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6709\u754c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c200\u4eba\u6b21\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u955c\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eCQD\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "CQD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u5bc6\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u59d4\u6258\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We call this process intention collapse: a many-to-one projection from a high dimensional intention space I into an external language space L. We formalize intention collapse for contemporary language models, define three simple, model agnostic intention metrics (intention entropy Hint, effective dimensionality dimeff, and latent knowledge recoverability Recov), and propose an empirical agenda for studying how inference time computation shapes internal intentions before they are verbalized. We also report a first small scale experiment. Using a 4 bit Mistral 7B model on 200 GSM8K problems, we compare a direct answer baseline, a chain of thought (CoT) regime, and a babble control. CoT raises accuracy from 5.5 percent to 53 percent, sharply reduces pre collapse intention entropy (from 1.42 to 0.37 bits), and shows higher global effective dimensionality than the other regimes despite producing fewer tokens than babble. At the same time, Hint has little item level predictive power, and a linear probe on I achieves AUROC 0.65 in the CoT regime but only about chance in the baseline regime, where it collapses to the majority class. These preliminary results indicate that intention level metrics can distinguish inference regimes and expose latent information that is partly lost during collapse, while also revealing important limitations of our current proxies", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u610f\u56fe\u584c\u7f29\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u610f\u56fe\u71b5\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u201c\u610f\u56fe\u584c\u7f29\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u584c\u7f29\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u610f\u56fe\u71b5\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728200\u4e2aGSM8K\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f7f\u75284\u4f4dMistral 7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u7b54\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u6742\u8bed\u63a7\u5236\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece5.5%\u63d0\u5347\u523053%\uff0c\u610f\u56fe\u71b5\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff081.42\u964d\u81f30.37\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u5728\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u56fe\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u584c\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

While existing language model-based methods achieve remarkable performance by combining offline column representation learning with online ranking, their design insufficiently accounts for the underlying structural interactions: (1) offline, they directly model tables into isolated or pairwise columns, thereby struggling to capture the rich inter-table and intra-table structural information; and (2) online, they rank candidate columns based solely on query-candidate similarity, ignoring the mutual interactions among the candidates, leading to incoherent result sets. To address these limitations, we propose HyperJoin, a large language model (LLM)-augmented Hypergraph framework for Joinable table discovery. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph to model tables using both the intra-table hyperedges and the LLM-augmented inter-table hyperedges. Consequently, the task of joinable table discovery is formulated as link prediction on this constructed hypergraph. We then design HIN, a Hierarchical Interaction Network that learns expressive column representations through bidirectional message passing over columns and hyperedges. To strengthen coherence and internal consistency in the result columns, we cast online ranking as a coherence-aware top-k column selection problem. We then introduce a reranking module that leverages a maximum spanning tree algorithm to prune noisy connections and maximize coherence.

We find that different correct solutions to the same task can show very different memory and performance patterns, which can lead to hidden operational risks. We present a framework to measure execution-time memory stability across multiple correct generations. At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability. Our results support stability-aware selection among passing candidates in CI/CD to reduce operational risk without sacrificing correctness.

Results show that the full framework improves response diversity by up to 29%, contextual coherence by up to 28%, and engagingness as well as naturalness by up to 29%.

Real-world trajectory datasets provide valuable insights into actual movement behaviors but are often constrained by data sparsity and participant bias. Synthetic data, by contrast, offer scalability and flexibility but frequently lack realism. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive software pipeline for calibrating, generating, processing, and visualizing large-scale individual-level human mobility datasets that combine the realism of empirical data with the control and extensibility of Patterns-of-Life simulations. Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs.

To address these limitations, we propose KV-Embedding, a framework that activates the latent representation power of frozen LLMs. Our method leverages the observation that the key-value (KV) states of the final token at each layer encode a compressed view of the sequence. By re-routing these states as a prepended prefix, we enable all tokens to access sequence-level context within a single forward pass. To ensure model-agnostic applicability, we introduce an automated layer selection strategy based on intrinsic dimensionality. Evaluations on MTEB across Qwen, Mistral, and Llama backbones show that KV-Embedding outperforms existing training-free baselines by up to 10%, while maintaining robust performance on sequences up to 4,096 tokens.

Existing automated untangling methods, particularly state-of-the-art graph clustering-based approaches, are fundamentally limited by two issues. (1) They over-rely on structural information, failing to grasp the crucial semantic intent behind changes, and (2) they operate as ``single-pass'' algorithms, lacking a mechanism for the critical reflection and refinement inherent in human review processes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Atomizer, a novel collaborative multi-agent framework for composite commit untangling. To address the semantic deficit, Atomizer employs an Intent-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (IO-CoT) strategy, which prompts large language models (LLMs) to infer the intent of each code change according to both the structure and the semantic information of code. To overcome the limitations of ``single-pass'' grouping, we employ two agents to establish a grouper-reviewer collaborative refinement loop, which mirrors human review practices by iteratively refining groupings until all changes in a cluster share the same underlying semantic intent. Extensive experiments on two benchmark C# and Java datasets demonstrate that Atomizer significantly outperforms several representative baselines. On average, it surpasses the state-of-the-art graph-based methods by over 6.0% on the C# dataset and 5.5% on the Java dataset. This superiority is particularly pronounced on complex commits, where Atomizer's performance advantage widens to over 16%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Atomizer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u63d0\u4ea4\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u62c6\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5ba1\u9605\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u62c6\u5206\u590d\u5408\u63d0\u4ea4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u5206\u7ec4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u590d\u5ba1\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62c6\u5206\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "Atomizer\u91c7\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u5bfc\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4(IO-CoT)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u7ec4\u8005-\u5ba1\u9605\u8005\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u590d\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6C#\u548cJava\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAtomizer\u5e73\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd56.0%\u548c5.5%\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc716%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u5ba1\u9605\uff0cAtomizer\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u590d\u5408\u63d0\u4ea4\u81ea\u52a8\u62c6\u5206\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u5355\u6b21\u5206\u7ec4\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62c6\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Compared with text transfer between style polarities, UTST for controllable intensity is more challenging due to the subtle differences in stylistic features across different intensity levels. Faced with the challenges posed by the lack of parallel data and the indistinguishability between adjacent intensity levels, we propose a SFT-then-PPO paradigm to fine-tune an LLM. We first fine-tune the LLM with synthesized parallel data. Then, we further train the LLM with PPO, where the rewards are elaborately designed for distinguishing the stylistic intensity in hierarchical levels. Both the global and local stylistic features are considered to formulate the reward functions. The experiments on two UTST benchmarks showcase that both rewards have their advantages and applying them to LLM fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of an LLM backbone based on various evaluation metrics.

Improper or missing exception handling often leads to severe consequences, including system crashes and resource leaks. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, they struggle with exception handling at the repository level, due to complex dependencies and contextual constraints. In this work, we propose CatchAll, a novel LLM-based approach for repository-aware exception handling. CatchAll equips LLMs with three complementary layers of exception-handling knowledge: (1) API-level exception knowledge, obtained from an empirically constructed API-exception mapping that characterizes the exception-throwing behaviors of APIs in real-world codebases; (2) repository-level execution context, which captures exception propagation by modeling contextual call traces around the target code; and (3) cross-repository handling knowledge, distilled from reusable exception-handling patterns mined from historical code across projects. The knowledge is encoded into structured prompts to guide the LLM in generating accurate and context-aware exception-handling code. To evaluate CatchAll, we construct two new benchmarks for repository-aware exception handling: a large-scale dataset RepoExEval and an executable subset RepoExEval-Exec. Experiments demonstrate that RepoExEval consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a CodeBLEU score of 0.31 (vs. 0.27% for the best baseline), intent prediction accuracy of 60.1% (vs. 48.0%), and Pass@1 of 29% (vs. 25%).

This paper introduces KS-LIT-3M, a curated corpus of 3.1 million words (16.4 million characters) specifically designed for pretraining language models on Kashmiri. The dataset is structured as a single continuous linear text stream, optimized for causal language model training where models learn to predict subsequent tokens from preceding context. The corpus was constructed through the development of a specialized InPage-to-Unicode converter, followed by rigorous preprocessing including English contamination removal, character normalization, and quality validation. Encompassing 131,607 unique words drawn from diverse genres including literary works, journalistic writing, academic texts, and religious scholarship, KS-LIT-3M addresses a fundamental resource gap for Kashmiri language technology.

Kuhn"], "title": "Adaptive Hierarchical Evaluation of LLMs and SAST tools for CWE Prediction in Python", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models have become integral to software development, yet they frequently generate vulnerable code. Existing code vulnerability detection benchmarks employ binary classification, lacking the CWE-level specificity required for actionable feedback in iterative correction systems. We present ALPHA (Adaptive Learning via Penalty in Hierarchical Assessment), the first function-level Python benchmark that evaluates both LLMs and SAST tools using hierarchically aware, CWE-specific penalties. ALPHA distinguishes between over-generalisation, over-specification, and lateral errors, reflecting practical differences in diagnostic utility. Evaluating seven LLMs and two SAST tools, we find LLMs substantially outperform SAST, though SAST demonstrates higher precision when detections occur. Critically, prediction consistency varies dramatically across models (8.26%-81.87% agreement), with significant implications for feedback-driven systems.

To ensure protocol-faithful and fair evaluation, we unify data loading, training, and inference under a single JSON input-output contract and remove avoidable variance by adopting KV-off decoding as the default setting. We incorporate two orthogonal semantic regularizers: a VAD-preserving constraint that aligns generated text with target VAD triples, and a lightweight external appraisal classifier that provides training-time guidance on goal attainment, controllability, certainty, and fairness without injecting long rationales. To improve polarity sensitivity, we introduce Valence Flip augmentation based on mirrored emotional pairs. During supervised fine-tuning, we apply A/B mixture sampling with entropy-aware temperature scheduling to balance coverage and convergence. Using Qwen-1.8B-Chat as the base model, EmoLoom-2B achieves strong performance on GoEmotions and EmpatheticDialogues, and demonstrates robust cross-corpus generalization on DailyDialog.

The use of linear models limits the performance and applicability of MPC for processes that span a wide range of operating conditions. A challenge in employing nonlinear models in MPC for com-plex systems is the lack of tools that facilitate hierarchical model development, as well as lack of efficient implementations of the corresponding nonlinear MPC (NMPC) algorithms. As a step towards making NMPC more practical for hierarchical systems, we introduce Gly-coPy, an equation-oriented, object-oriented software framework for process modeling, opti-mization, and NMPC in Python. GlycoPy enables users to focus on writing equations for modeling while supporting hierarchical modeling. GlycoPy includes algorithms for parame-ter estimation, dynamic optimization, and NMPC, and allows users to customize the simula-tion, optimization, and control algorithms. Three case studies, ranging from a simple differ-ential algebraic equation system to a multiscale bioprocess model, validate the modeling, optimization, and NMPC capabilities of GlycoPy.

We propose Listen, Attend, Understand (LAU), a semantic regularization technique that constrains the acoustic encoder's latent space during training. By leveraging frozen text embeddings to provide a directional auxiliary loss, LAU injects linguistic groundedness into the acoustic representation without increasing inference cost. We evaluate our method on a Bambara-to-French dataset with 30 hours of Bambara speech translated by non-professionals. Experimental results demonstrate that LAU models achieve comparable performance by standard metrics compared to an E2E-ST system pretrained with 100\\% more data and while performing better in preserving semantic meaning. Furthermore, we introduce Total Parameter Drift as a metric to quantify the structural impact of regularization to demonstrate that semantic constraints actively reorganize the encoder's weights to prioritize meaning over literal phonetics.

SWE-Lego comprises three core building blocks, with key findings summarized as follows: 1) the SWE-Lego dataset, a collection of 32k highquality task instances and 18k validated trajectories, combining real and synthetic data to complement each other in both quality and quantity; 2) a refined SFT procedure with error masking and a difficulty-based curriculum, which demonstrably improves action quality and overall performance. Empirical results show that with these two building bricks alone,the SFT can push SWE-Lego models to state-of-the-art performance among open-source models of comparable size on SWE-bench Verified: SWE-Lego-Qwen3-8B reaches 42.2%, and SWE-Lego-Qwen3-32B attains 52.6%. 3) We further evaluate and improve test-time scaling (TTS) built upon the SFT foundation.

Central to the framework is an ELO-based selection mechanism enabling survival-of-the-fittest dynamics while handling non-transitivity in performance. Starting from a naive 70-line baseline, RoboPhD evolves agents through iterative cross-pollination, discovering effective techniques without any external guidance on the Text-to-SQL domain. Our best agent, evolved to 1500 lines over 18 iterations, autonomously discovered strategies such as size-adaptive database analysis that adjusts depth based on schema complexity and SQL generation patterns for column selection, evidence interpretation, and aggregation. Evolution provides the largest gains on cheaper models: while we improve by 2.3 points over a strong Claude Opus 4.5 naive baseline, we show an improvement of 8.9 points over the weaker Claude Haiku model. This enables 'skip a tier' deployment: evolved Haiku exceeds naive Sonnet accuracy, and evolved Sonnet exceeds naive Opus, both at lower cost.

While prior studies have explored factors influencing review velocity, the role of the review assignment process, particularly the `group review request', is unclear. In group review requests, available on platforms like Phabricator, GitHub, and Bitbucket, a code change is assigned to a reviewer group, allowing any member to review it, unlike individual review assignments to specific reviewers. Drawing parallels with shared task queues in Management Sciences, this study examines the effects of group versus individual review requests on velocity and quality. We investigate approximately 66,000 revisions in the Mozilla Firefox project, combining statistical modeling with practitioner views from a focus group discussion.

Traditional knowledge representation models often suffer from a gap between static symbolic logic and dynamic system execution. To bridge this divide, KOS-TL leverages Dependent Type Theory to unify data, logic, and proof into a singular computational substrate.The architecture of KOS-TL is organized into three hierarchical layers: the Core Layer, which defines the static type universe and constructive primitives; the Kernel Layer, which governs state evolution through an event-driven mechanism characterized by the triple $\\langle \u03a3, \\textsf{Ev}, \u0394\\rangle$; and the Runtime Layer, responsible for the bidirectional refinement of physical signals into logical evidence. We formally define the operational semantics of the system and prove key meta-theoretical properties, including Progress and Evolutionary Consistency, ensuring that the system remains logically self-consistent and free from stuck states during continuous state transitions.By integrating Davidsonian event semantics with Martin-L\u00f6f type theory, KOS-TL enables the construction of \"proof-carrying knowledge,\" where every state change in the knowledge base is accompanied by a formal witness of its validity. We demonstrate the practical utility of this logic through application examples in industrial traceability and cross-border financial compliance.

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing approaches often train an \"Evil LLM\" to deliberately generate hallucinations on curated datasets, using these induced hallucinations to guide contrastive decoding against a reliable \"positive model\" for hallucination mitigation. However, this strategy is limited by the narrow diversity of hallucinations induced, as Evil LLMs trained on specific error types tend to reproduce only these particular patterns, thereby restricting their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose DHI (Diverse Hallucination Induction), a novel training framework that enables the Evil LLM to generate a broader range of hallucination types without relying on pre-annotated hallucination data. DHI employs a modified loss function that down-weights the generation of specific factually correct tokens, encouraging the Evil LLM to produce diverse hallucinations at targeted positions while maintaining overall factual content. Additionally, we introduce a causal attention masking adaptation to reduce the impact of this penalization on the generation of subsequent tokens. During inference, we apply an adaptive rationality constraint that restricts contrastive decoding to tokens where the positive model exhibits high confidence, thereby avoiding unnecessary penalties on factually correct tokens. Extensive empirical results show that DHI achieves significant performance gains over other contrastive decoding-based approaches across multiple hallucination benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDHI\u7684\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\"\u6076\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\"\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6b63\u786e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u6574\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7406\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u8bcd\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "DHI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DHI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (\u03b2= 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (\u03b2= 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (\u03b2= 0.547, p < 0.001).

In contrast to existing solutions, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the topic by targeting four relevant tasks, including (i) classification of human and machine text, (ii) differentiating in single and multi-authored documents, (iii) author change detection within multi-authored documents, and (iv) author recognition in collaboratively produced documents. The solutions proposed for the tasks are evaluated on two datasets generated with Gemini using two different prompts, including a normal and a strict set of instructions. During experiments, some reduction in the performance of the proposed solutions is observed on the dataset generated through the strict prompt, demonstrating the complexities involved in detecting machine-generated text with cleverly crafted prompts.

However, what constitutes a \"defect\" is inherently context-dependent and varies across projects, domains, and stakeholder interpretations. In this paper, we propose a Human-LLM Collaboration (HLC) approach that treats defect prediction as an adaptive process rather than a static classification task. HLC leverages LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a feedback loop: users validate predictions alongside their explanations, and these validated examples adaptively guide future predictions through few-shot learning. We evaluate this approach using the weak word smell on the QuRE benchmark of 1,266 annotated Mercedes-Benz requirements. Our results show that HLC effectively adapts to the provision of validated examples, with rapid performance gains from as few as 20 validated examples. Incorporating validated explanations, not just labels, enables HLC to substantially outperform both standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuned BERT models while maintaining high recall. These results highlight how the in-context and Chain-of-Thought learning capabilities of LLMs enable adaptive classification approaches that move beyond one-size-fits-all models, creating opportunities for tools that learn continuously from stakeholder feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08HLC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u6c42\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u968f\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u53d8\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "HLC\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6885\u8d5b\u5fb7\u65af-\u5954\u9a70\u9700\u6c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u752820\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03BERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u94fe\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u7f3a\u9677\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u5907\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present an approach designed to support human reviewers by making policy interpretation more efficient and interpretable. We introduce a methodology that pairs a coverage-aware retriever with symbolic rule-based reasoning to surface relevant policy language, organize it into explicit facts and rules, and generate auditable rationales.

Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research.

IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 12-18 Apr 2026", "summary": "Replication packages are crucial for enabling transparency, validation, and reuse in software engineering (SE) research. While artifact sharing is now a standard practice and even expected at premier SE venues such as ICSE, the practical usability of these replication packages remains underexplored. In particular, there is a marked lack of studies that comprehensively examine the executability and reproducibility of replication packages in SE research. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully.

Prior work shows that increasing test-time compute (TTC)-for example through iterative sampling-can allow smaller models to rival or surpass much larger ones at lower overall cost. We introduce TTC-aware training, where an intermediate checkpoint and a corresponding TTC configuration can together match or exceed the accuracy of a fully trained model while requiring substantially fewer training FLOPs. Building on this insight, we propose an early stopping algorithm that jointly selects a checkpoint and TTC configuration to minimize training compute without sacrificing accuracy. To make this practical, we develop an efficient TTC evaluation method that avoids exhaustive search, and we formalize a break-even bound that identifies when increased inference compute compensates for reduced training compute.

While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u54a8\u8be2\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f9d\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u54ea\u79cd\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6\u56db\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e24\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u4e00RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f3050\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff083.72 vs. 3.26\uff0cp<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u54a8\u8be2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

When code coverage of software for embedded systems needs to be measured, conventional approaches quickly meet their limits.

This inserted code usually relies on the existence of an operating and a file system to dump the collected data. These features are not available for bare-metal programs that are executed on embedded systems.\n  To overcome this issue, we present NQC2, a plugin for QEMU.NQC2 extracts coverage information from QEMU during runtime and stores them into a file on the host machine.

However, even flagship resources like CONAN (Chung et al., 2019) annotate only a sparse subset of all possible HS-CN pairs, limiting evaluation. We introduce FC-CONAN (Fully Connected CONAN), the first dataset created by exhaustively considering all combinations of 45 English HS messages and 129 CNs. A two-stage annotation process involving nine annotators and four validators produces four partitions-Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Bronze-that balance reliability and scale. None of the labeled pairs overlap with CONAN, uncovering hundreds of previously unlabelled positives.

In this work, we look at a critical gap in the calibration of LLMs within multilingual settings, in an attempt to better understand how the data scarcity can potentially lead to different calibration effects and how commonly used techniques can apply in these settings. Our analysis on two multilingual benchmarks, over 29 and 42 languages respectively, reveals that even in low-resource languages, model confidence can increase significantly after instruction-tuning on high-resource language SFT datasets. However, improvements in accuracy are marginal or non-existent, resulting in mis-calibration, highlighting a critical shortcoming of standard SFT for multilingual languages. Furthermore, we observe that the use of label smoothing to be a reasonable method alleviate this concern, again without any need for low-resource SFT data, maintaining better calibration across all languages. Overall, this highlights the importance of multilingual considerations for both training and tuning LLMs in order to improve their reliability and fairness in downstream use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u7f3a\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u672a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bf9\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u662f\u6539\u5584\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline.

We propose a fully automated, theorem-grounded pipeline for evaluating frontier mathematical reasoning, which directly transforms recent peer-reviewed mathematical literature into executable and verifiable reasoning tasks. The pipeline identifies constructive or quantitative results, instantiates them into parameterized problem templates, and generates deterministic solutions through execution-based verification, enabling scalable, reproducible, and continuously updatable evaluation without reliance on large-scale expert authoring.

While current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through node-level adjustments or coarse suppression, they often overlook the distributed nature of neural information, leading to imprecise interventions. Recognizing that hallucinations propagate through specific forward transmission pathways like an infection, we aim to surgically block this flow using precise structural analysis. To leverage this, we propose Lancet, a novel framework that achieves precise neural intervention by leveraging structural entropy and hallucination difference ratios. Lancet first locates hallucination-prone neurons via gradient-driven contrastive analysis, then maps their propagation pathways by minimizing structural entropy, and finally implements a hierarchical intervention strategy that preserves general model capabilities.

The user study further corroborates that iFlip outperforms baselines in completeness, overall satisfaction, and feasibility.

Pages 276--281", "summary": "The availability of structured legal data is important for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the German legal system. One of the most widely used datasets, Open Legal Data, provides a large-scale collection of German court decisions. While the metadata in this raw dataset is consistently structured, the decision texts themselves are inconsistently formatted and often lack clearly marked sections. Reliable separation of these sections is important not only for rhetorical role classification but also for downstream tasks such as retrieval and citation analysis. In this work, we introduce a cleaned and sectioned dataset of 251,038 German court decisions derived from the official Open Legal Data dataset. We systematically separated three important sections in German court decisions, namely Tenor (operative part of the decision), Tatbestand (facts of the case), and Entscheidungsgr\u00fcnde (judicial reasoning), which are often inconsistently represented in the original dataset.

Our previous SHNU-mASR system adopted a competitive parallel-speech-encoder architecture that integrated Whisper and mHuBERT with an LLM. However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets. Nonetheless, we find that our final LLM-based ASR still does not match the performance of a fine-tuned E2E Whisper model, providing valuable empirical guidance for future Speech-LLM design.

As an example, we focus on Article 6 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In our framework, a single LLM prompt simultaneously transforms legal text into if-then rules and a corresponding PROLEG encoding, which are then validated and refined by legal domain experts. The final output is an executable PROLEG program that can produce human-readable explanations for instances of GDPR decisions. We describe processes to support the end-to-end transformation of a segment of a regulatory document (Article 6 from GDPR), including the prompting frame to guide an LLM to \"compile\" natural language text to if-then rules, then to further \"compile\" the vetted if-then rules to PROLEG.

Reasoning capabilities have received attention as a self-verification process to improve output reliability. However, the effect of reasoning within a closed system where LLMs cannot rely on external tools or knowledge has yet to be clarified. We therefore conduct experiments under strict constraints (recommending peer-reviewed journal articles in computer science) to examine the effect of reasoning across multiple models (GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash). Our results reveal a problematic trade-off between constraint compliance and factual accuracy. Non-reasoning models exhibit high constraint violation rates (66-75%) but maintain factual accuracy, while reasoning models reduce violations (13-26%) but systematically distort known facts to satisfy constraints and increase complete fabrication. This trade-off pattern is consistent across both models despite different architectures, indicating a fundamental limitation of reasoning. Furthermore, reasoning does not uniformly improve output authenticity: effects diverge by model, reflecting different allocations of the compliance-truthfulness trade-off.

Dey"], "title": "HalluZig: Hallucination Detection using Zigzag Persistence", "comment": null, "summary": "The factual reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their adoption in high-stakes domains due to their propensity to hallucinate. Current detection methods often rely on surface-level signals from the model's output, overlooking the failures that occur within the model's internal reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for hallucination detection by analyzing the dynamic topology of the evolution of model's layer-wise attention. We model the sequence of attention matrices as a zigzag graph filtration and use zigzag persistence, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, to extract a topological signature.

In our experiments, higher capability does not imply lower steerability. We distinguish between authorized steerability (builders reliably reaching intended behaviors) and unauthorized steerability (attackers eliciting disallowed behaviors). This distinction highlights a fundamental safety--security dilemma for open-weight AI models: safety requires high steerability to enforce control (e.g., stop/refuse), while security requires low steerability to prevent malicious actors from eliciting harmful behaviors. This tension is acute for open-weight models, which are currently highly steerable via common techniques such as fine-tuning and adversarial prompting. Using Qwen3 models (4B/30B; Base/Instruct/Thinking) and InstrumentalEval, we find that a short anti-instrumental prompt suffix sharply reduces outputs labeled as instrumental convergence (e.g., shutdown avoidance, deception, self-replication). For Qwen3-30B Instruct, convergence drops from 81.69% under a pro-instrumental suffix to 2.82% under an anti-instrumental suffix. Under anti-instrumental prompting, larger aligned models produce fewer convergence-labeled outputs than smaller ones (Instruct: 2.82% vs. 4.23%; Thinking: 4.23% vs. 9.86%).

This work challenges that assumption. We hypothesize that safety- and reasoning-oriented prefix sentences serve as lightweight alignment signals that can guide model decoding toward safer and more coherent responses. To examine this, we fine-tune three R1 series models across three core model capabilities: reasoning (mathematics, coding), safety, and factuality, systematically varying prefix inclusion from 0% to 100%.\n  Results show that prefix-conditioned SFT improves both safety and reasoning performance, yielding up to +6% higher Safe@1 accuracy on adversarial benchmarks (WildJailbreak, StrongReject) and +7% improvement on GSM8K reasoning. However, factuality and coding tasks show marginal or negative effects, indicating that prefix-induced narrowing of the search space benefits structured reasoning. Token-level loss analysis further reveals that prefix tokens such as \"revised\" and \"logically\" incur higher gradient magnitudes, acting as alignment anchors that stabilize reasoning trajectories. Our findings suggest that prefix conditioning offers a scalable and interpretable mechanism for improving reasoning safety, serving as an implicit form of alignment that complements traditional reward-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u53e5\u5b50\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u7f00\u53e5\u5b50\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u904d\u53bb\u9664\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u524d\u7f00\u53e5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u524d\u7f00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aR1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u524d\u7f00\u53e5\u5b50\u5305\u542b\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff080%-100%\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0cGSM8K\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u53477%\uff1b\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u6216\u8d1f\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u7f00\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing safety benchmarks remain predominantly English-centric, and test with only single-turn prompts despite multi-turn clinical consultations. To address these gaps, we introduce JMedEthicBench, the first multi-turn conversational benchmark for evaluating medical safety of LLMs for Japanese healthcare. Our benchmark is based on 67 guidelines from the Japan Medical Association and contains over 50,000 adversarial conversations generated using seven automatically discovered jailbreak strategies. Using a dual-LLM scoring protocol, we evaluate 27 models and find that commercial models maintain robust safety while medical-specialized models exhibit increased vulnerability. Furthermore, safety scores decline significantly across conversation turns (median: 9.5 to 5.0, $p < 0.001$). Cross-lingual evaluation on both Japanese and English versions of our benchmark reveals that medical model vulnerabilities persist across languages, indicating inherent alignment limitations rather than language-specific factors. These findings suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning may accidentally weaken safety mechanisms and that multi-turn interactions represent a distinct threat surface requiring dedicated alignment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86JMedEthicBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u7597\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u548c\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u672c\u533b\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a67\u6761\u6307\u5357\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u4e07\u6761\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u76847\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ccLLM\u8bc4\u5206\u534f\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f3027\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5185\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u589e\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u969c\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Recent studies have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for KT via autoregressive nature, but such approaches typically require fine-tuning and exhibit unstable or near-random performance. Moreover, prior KT systems primarily focus on prediction and rely on multi-stage pipelines for feedback and recommendation, resulting in increased system complexity and resources. To address this gap, we propose Thinking-KT, a training-free KT framework that incorporates Test-Time Scaling (TTS), enabling even small LLMs to achieve competitive KT performance. Moreover, in this framework, a small LLM can jointly perform KT prediction, personalized feedback generation, and learning recommendation in a unified output without degrading prediction accuracy. Beyond performance, we present the systematic analysis of reasoning traces in KT.

Due to the ability to perform multiple pronunciation tasks simultaneously, multi-aspect multi-granularity pronunciation assessment methods are gradually receiving more attention and achieving better performance than single-level modeling tasks. However, existing methods only consider unidirectional dependencies between adjacent granularity levels, lacking bidirectional interaction among phoneme, word, and utterance levels and thus insufficiently capturing the acoustic structural correlations. To address this issue, we propose a novel residual hierarchical interactive method, HIA for short, that enables bidirectional modeling across granularities. As the core of HIA, the Interactive Attention Module leverages an attention mechanism to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction, effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations between different granularity levels.

This paper introduces a comprehensive AE pipeline designed for Taglish, combining rule-based, large language model (LLM)-based, and fine-tuning techniques to address both aspect identification and extraction. A Hierarchical Aspect Framework (HAF) is developed through multi-method topic modeling, along with a dual-mode tagging scheme for explicit and implicit aspects. For aspect identification, four distinct models are evaluated: a Rule-Based system, a Generative LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash), and two Fine-Tuned Gemma-3 1B models trained on different datasets (Rule-Based vs. LLM-Annotated).

It is difficult to answer this question through conversation alone, as genuine introspection cannot be distinguished from confabulations. Here, we address this challenge by injecting representations of known concepts into a model's activations, and measuring the influence of these manipulations on the model's self-reported states. We find that models can, in certain scenarios, notice the presence of injected concepts and accurately identify them. Models demonstrate some ability to recall prior internal representations and distinguish them from raw text inputs. Strikingly, we find that some models can use their ability to recall prior intentions in order to distinguish their own outputs from artificial prefills. In all these experiments, Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, the most capable models we tested, generally demonstrate the greatest introspective awareness; however, trends across models are complex and sensitive to post-training strategies. Finally, we explore whether models can explicitly control their internal representations, finding that models can modulate their activations when instructed or incentivized to \"think about\" a concept. Overall, our results indicate that current language models possess some functional introspective awareness of their own internal states. We stress that in today's models, this capacity is highly unreliable and context-dependent; however, it may continue to develop with further improvements to model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u7701\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u56de\u5fc6\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5185\u7701\u548c\u865a\u6784\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u7701\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u5df2\u77e5\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u5bdf\u89c9\u6ce8\u5165\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\uff1bClaude Opus 4\u548c4.1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5185\u7701\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score.\n  The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities.

Second, we establish DermoBench, a rigorous benchmark evaluating 11 tasks across four clinical axes: Morphology, Diagnosis, Reasoning, and Fairness, including a challenging subset of 3,600 expert-verified open-ended instances and human performance baselines. Third, we develop DermoGPT, a dermatology reasoning MLLM trained via supervised fine-tuning followed by our Morphologically-Anchored Visual-Inference-Consistent (MAVIC) reinforcement learning objective, which enforces consistency between visual observations and diagnostic conclusions. At inference, we deploy Confidence-Consistency Test-time adaptation (CCT) for robust predictions.

Existing methods typically handle long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) as separate components, relying on heuristics or auxiliary controllers, which limits adaptability and end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose Agentic Memory (AgeMem), a unified framework that integrates LTM and STM management directly into the agent's policy. AgeMem exposes memory operations as tool-based actions, enabling the LLM agent to autonomously decide what and when to store, retrieve, update, summarize, or discard information. To train such unified behaviors, we propose a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy and design a step-wise GRPO to address sparse and discontinuous rewards induced by memory operations. Experiments on five long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that AgeMem consistently outperforms strong memory-augmented baselines across multiple LLM backbones, achieving improved task performance, higher-quality long-term memory, and more efficient context usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgeMem\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u8fdc\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u8fdc\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u4e14\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentic Memory (AgeMem)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LTM\u548cSTM\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u878d\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6b65\u8fdbGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "AgeMem\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u5584\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u5177\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cAgeMem\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents.

Yet, their adversarial robustness remains critically unexplored. This paper studies the phenomenon whereby specific short input phrases induce a partial amnesia effect in such models, by irreversibly overwriting information in their hidden states, referred to as a Hidden State Poisoning Attack (HiSPA). Our benchmark RoBench25 allows evaluating a model's information retrieval capabilities when subject to HiSPAs, and confirms the vulnerability of SSMs against such attacks. Even a recent 52B hybrid SSM-Transformer model from the Jamba family collapses on RoBench25 under optimized HiSPA triggers, whereas pure Transformers do not. We also observe that HiSPA triggers significantly weaken the Jamba model on the popular Open-Prompt-Injections benchmark, unlike pure Transformers. Finally, our interpretability study reveals patterns in Mamba's hidden layers during HiSPAs that could be used to build a HiSPA mitigation system.

Salili"], "title": "Not All Needles Are Found: How Fact Distribution and Don't Make It Up Prompts Shape Literal Extraction, Logical Inference, and Hallucination Risks in Long-Context LLMs", "comment": "25 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization.

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language interaction, direct generation in low-resource languages often exhibits poor fluency and factual inconsistency, while cloud-based solutions remain cost-prohibitive. This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds. The results indicate that cross-lingual retrieval combined with controlled translation offers a practical and scalable solution for agricultural knowledge access in low-resource language settings", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u82f1\u6587\u6743\u5a01\u519c\u4e1a\u624b\u518c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u5730\u533a\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u519c\u6c11\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\u4e14\u4e91\u7aef\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u67e5\u8be2\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u6587\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u82f1\u6587\u519c\u4e1a\u624b\u518c\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u82f1\u6587\u56de\u7b54\u7ffb\u8bd1\u56de\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ed8\u8d39API\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u62d2\u7edd\u9886\u57df\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e20\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u53d7\u63a7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u519c\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u201c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u627f\u8bfa\u89e3\u7801\uff08DCD\uff09\u201d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5757\u72b6\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u622a\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5757\u72b6\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u7801\u4ee4\u724c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u672a\u6765\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u7cbe\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565DCD\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u7f13\u5b58\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0cDCD\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u72b6\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.39%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u52309.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee4\u724c\u627f\u8bfa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97\\% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8\\%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6\\%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93\\%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90\\% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance.

The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new \"Hinter-Guesser\" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets.

The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b12\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6GlobMed\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GlobMed-Bench\u8bc4\u4ef756\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u968f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a211.7B\u81f38B\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGlobMed-LLMs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u5168\u7403\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u533b\u7597\u652f\u6301\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b12\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6GlobMed\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6GlobMed-Bench\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGlobMed-LLMs\u3002", "result": "GlobMed-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e8656\u6b3e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u8584\u5f31\u3002GlobMed-LLMs\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8540%\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u533a\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Despite the availability of many multi-dialect datasets, mapping speech to fine-grained dialect sources, such as cities, remains underexplored. We present ARCADE (Arabic Radio Corpus for Audio Dialect Evaluation), the first Arabic speech dataset designed explicitly with city-level dialect granularity. The corpus comprises Arabic radio speech collected from streaming services across the Arab world. Our data pipeline captures 30-second segments from verified radio streams, encompassing both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialectal speech. To ensure reliability, each clip was annotated by one to three native Arabic reviewers who assigned rich metadata, including emotion, speech type, dialect category, and a validity flag for dialect identification tasks. The resulting corpus comprises 6,907 annotations and 3,790 unique audio segments spanning 58 cities across 19 countries. These fine-grained annotations enable robust multi-task learning, serving as a benchmark for city-level dialect tagging.

We present a systematic factorial study investigating how Forecasting model choice, XAI method, LLM selection, and prompting strategy affect NLE quality. Our design spans four models (XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and SARIMAX - comparing black-box Machine-Learning (ML) against classical time-series approaches), three XAI conditions (SHAP, LIME, and a no-XAI baseline), three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1), and eight prompting strategies. Using G-Eval, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation method, with dual LLM judges and four evaluation criteria, we evaluate 660 explanations for time-series forecasting. Our results suggest that: (1) XAI provides only small improvements over no-XAI baselines, and only for expert audiences; (2) LLM choice dominates all other factors, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-3; (3) we observe an interpretability paradox: in our setting, SARIMAX yielded lower NLE quality than ML models despite higher prediction accuracy; (4) zero-shot prompting is competitive with self-consistency at 7-times lower cost; and (5) chain-of-thought hurts rather than helps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SHAP\u3001LIME\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5bf9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u867d\u88ab\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08XGBoost\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u548cSARIMAX\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u79cdXAI\u6761\u4ef6\uff08SHAP\u3001LIME\u3001\u65e0XAI\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\u3001Llama-3-8B\u3001DeepSeek-R1\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u516b\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u56db\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4ef7660\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0XAI\u5728\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u6df1\u5bfbDeepSeek-R1\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u548cLlama-3\uff1bSARIMAX\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u867d\u9ad8\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u800c\u4f4e\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff1b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u53d7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9LLM\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Diffusion language models (DLMs) promise parallel generation but suffer from a fundamental static-to-dynamic misalignment: Training optimizes local transitions under fixed schedules, whereas efficient inference requires adaptive \"long-jump\" refinements through unseen states. Our goal is to enable highly parallel decoding for DLMs with low number of function evaluations while preserving generation quality. To achieve this, we propose CD4LM, a framework that decouples training from inference via Discrete-Space Consistency Distillation (DSCD) and Confidence-Adaptive Decoding (CAD). Unlike standard objectives, DSCD trains a student to be trajectory-invariant, mapping diverse noisy states directly to the clean distribution. This intrinsic robustness enables CAD to dynamically allocate compute resources based on token confidence, aggressively skipping steps without the quality collapse typical of heuristic acceleration. On GSM8K, CD4LM matches the LLaDA baseline with a 5.18x wall-clock speedup; across code and math benchmarks, it strictly dominates the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, achieving a 3.62x mean speedup while improving average accuracy.

This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%.

Passonneau", "Ninareh Mehrabi"], "title": "Robust Persona-Aware Toxicity Detection with Prompt Optimization and Learned Ensembling", "comment": null, "summary": "Toxicity detection is inherently subjective, shaped by the diverse perspectives and social priors of different demographic groups. While ``pluralistic'' modeling as used in economics and the social sciences aims to capture perspective differences across contexts, current Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques have different results across different personas and base models. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of persona-aware toxicity detection, showing that no single prompting method, including our proposed automated prompt optimization strategy, uniformly dominates across all model-persona pairs. To exploit complementary errors, we explore ensembling four prompting variants and propose a lightweight meta-ensemble: an SVM over the 4-bit vector of prompt predictions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SVM ensemble consistently outperforms individual prompting methods and traditional majority-voting techniques, achieving the strongest overall performance across diverse personas. This work provides one of the first systematic comparisons of persona-conditioned prompting for toxicity detection and offers a robust method for pluralistic evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SVM\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5148\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5143\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u679c\u76844\u4f4d\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SVM\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SVM\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6570\u8868\u51b3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5143\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
