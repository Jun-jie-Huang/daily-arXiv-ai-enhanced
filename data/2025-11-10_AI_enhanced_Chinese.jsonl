Analysis of refactoring types reveals that\nagentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as\nChange Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable\n(8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level\ndesign changes common in human refactoring.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where\nhigher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the\nreliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction\nhierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first\n\"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority\n(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability\nvia training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of\nconstraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both\naligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight\nreinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning\ncapabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models\nachieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction\nhierarchy benchmarks.

For example, they may want to\ndetermine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a\nconfiguration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the\ncode mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this\nproblem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file\ninstead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other\ntechniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g.,\nmethods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces\nCodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is\nindependent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a\ncode region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another\ncommit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by\nanalyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code\nfragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating\nsimilarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two\nnew hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular\nprogramming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target\nregion in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available\nbaselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CodeMapper\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f14\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e4b\u95f4\u67d0\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5982git diff\u53ea\u663e\u793a\u5168\u90e8\u6587\u4ef6\u6539\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6280\u672f\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u4ee3\u7801\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "CodeMapper\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u79fb\u52a8\u53ca\u641c\u7d22\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5019\u9009\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5341\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0cCodeMapper\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u572871.0%\u81f394.5%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e3a1.5%\u81f358.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeMapper\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5143\u7d20\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u5339\u914d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including\nLayer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues\nthat drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression\nfrom suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned\ntransformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,\nwhile also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and\nhuman-in-the-loop safety protocols.

A natural strategy to increase\nthe likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of\nretrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce\nsignificant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby\nreducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the\nchallenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose\nWinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy\ndocuments while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as\nwinnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware\nclustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each\ncluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage\nII, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of\nmultiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To\nretain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic\nmerging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for\ngenerating the final response.

To address these\nchallenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as\na method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a\nsmaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree\nto which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal\nrepresentations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current\naccuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality\nand often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity\nbetween the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically\nshow that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,\nresulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,\nwhich is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we\npropose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically\nevaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student\nmodels under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate\nMetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular\nlanguage models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation\ntechniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress\nidentifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring\nthe need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation\npipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing\ncompressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u4eff\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMetaCompress\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaCompress\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5173\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "MetaCompress\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe62%\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe285%\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002MetaCompress\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Technique.\" (2025)", "summary": "Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource\nlanguages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on\nwidespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language\nunderstanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark\nestablished for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and\ncompetitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark\ncomprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five\ncomplexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading\nproprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a\none-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against\nhidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even\ntop-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the\nproblems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural\nlanguage. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of\nperformance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of\nsolution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time\nand memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work\ndemonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating\nlarge language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves\nthe way for future research on multilingual code generation and\nreasoning-enhanced models.

Current training sample influence estimation\nmethods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing\ninformation flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order\ngradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of\nbillions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to\nsome subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal\nwork by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for\ncomputing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers\nare the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on\ninfluence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,\nwe propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the\ncancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better\nestimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of\naggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to\nstandard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to\nsignificantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for\nevaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model\nretraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)\nthat exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.\nThrough extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we\nconcretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than\nthe last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior\nknowledge in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u8ba4\u4e3a\u524d\u5c42\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807NDR\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e14\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e4b\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u53cd\u9a73\u201c\u62b5\u6d88\u6548\u5e94\u201d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6392\u540d\u548c\u6295\u7968\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff08NDR\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65b0\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14NDR\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7ffb\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u524d\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has\ndemonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models\ntrain longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,\nthose with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,\nfewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering\neffectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore\nResidual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages\nexploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals.

Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise).

While recent advances have extended context\nwindows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource\nconstrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented\narchitecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.\nOur system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience\nscoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide\nwhich information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike\nexisting retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,\nBudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval\nfor efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700\nquestion answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)\ndocuments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves\nremarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while\nsaving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through\nbudget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline\ncomparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits\nincrease with document length.

We find that models struggle most\nwith traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''\nand ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial\naggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a\npoor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned\nmodels performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic\nevidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model\nsafety and creative fidelity.

In\ncontrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our\nunderstanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In\nthis work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the\norder-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the\nsame order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we\ndiscover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on\nthese two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a\ntraining-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA\nas a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes\nOLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter\ngeneralizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates.

Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM.

QWen also\nattains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a\ndisconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a\nstatistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a\ncomprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,\ndiscourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for\nmechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five\nreadability indices.

An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach\nhas been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative\nevaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by\nmeasuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a\nset of representative datasets.

The distilled\nmodels are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks\nfrom the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for\nsmaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving\nwhite-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better\naverage performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from\nBBH.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\uff08CoT\uff09\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u767d\u76d2\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4f7f\u7528CoT\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u767d\u76d2\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528CoT-Collection\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06Qwen\u548cLlama2\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728BIG-Bench-Hard\uff08BBH\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eCoT\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoT\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This often results in a trade-off that compromises output\nquality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a\nhigh-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly\nrewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection\nmodule is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning\nis employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core\npersonalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to\nuser-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to\nfurther refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.\nComprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by\ndecoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of\nexplicit response shaping over implicit context injection.

This research proposal focuses on the study of\nthe mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak\nmultiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al.

When the same\nresponse strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different\nsatisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual\nintents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train\none-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking\nminority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified\nframework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user\nsatisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning\n(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning\nchains.

To\nbetter leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a\nsimple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight\narithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the\nweight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired\nbehavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this\ndirection to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate\nsycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often\ngeneralizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger\nout-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.\nWe also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering\ncan partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and\nunder-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance\ngains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can\nbe detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an\n\"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the\nevolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that\nnever manifest during training or evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7b97\u672f\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u65e2\u56f0\u96be\u53c8\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e24\u6b21\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u589e\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u51cf\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u51cf\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u62cd\u9a6c\u5c41\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
