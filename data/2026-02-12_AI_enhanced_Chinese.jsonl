A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring. Our research highlights how AgentTrace can enable more reliable agent deployment, fine-grained risk analysis, and informed trust calibration, thereby addressing critical concerns that have so far limited the use of LLM agents in sensitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentTrace\u52a8\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0cAgentTrace\u6355\u83b7\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u53ef\u5185\u7701\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "AgentTrace\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u548c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5236\u7ea6LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentTrace\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9065\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u5185\u7701\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Generated Python implementations are assessed through staged executability checks, model-independent statistical comparison against a validated NetLogo baseline, and quantitative measures of runtime efficiency and maintainability.

However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone.

To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints.

Current evaluations systematically overlook the third goal. Specifically, they either treat existing code as ground truth (a compliance trap) for regression prevention, or depend on post-failure artifacts (e.g., issue reports) for bug reproduction-so they rarely surface defects before failures. To bridge this gap, we present TestExplora, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs as proactive testers within full-scale, realistic repository environments. TestExplora contains 2,389 tasks from 482 repositories and hides all defect-related signals. Models must proactively find bugs by comparing implementations against documentation-derived intent, using documentation as the oracle. Furthermore, to keep evaluation sustainable and reduce leakage, we propose continuous, time-aware data collection. Our evaluation reveals a significant capability gap: state-of-the-art models achieve a maximum Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rate of only 16.06%. Further analysis indicates that navigating complex cross-module interactions and leveraging agentic exploration are critical to advancing LLMs toward autonomous software quality assurance.

The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission.

Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLT-Tuning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u7ef4\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u584c\u9677\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "LT-Tuning\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Context-Prediction-Fusion\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLT-Tuning\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LT-Tuning\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u584c\u9677\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy.

Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics.

Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9a71\u9010\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9a71\u9010\u6216\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u4e14\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9a71\u9010\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8\u7684RL\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u672a\u6765\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6RULER\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6OASST2-4k\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KV Policy (KVP)\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous).

Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected \"social world models\" rather than isolated competencies. This work contributes novel ToM localizer data, methodological refinements to functional localization techniques, and empirical insights into the emergence of social cognition in artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5177\u5907\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5fc3\u667a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u56de\u7b54\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u201c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u5fc3\u667a\uff08ToM\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5fc3\u667a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529bEmergence\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u201c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

This theory helps software developers explain the challenges they face and the project risks that emerge as troubleshooting becomes difficult. We define troubleshooting as the cognitive problem-solving process of identifying, understanding, and constructing a mental model of the cause of an unexpected system behavior, and consider the cognitive process of troubleshooting to be an integral part of the activity of debugging. Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data. Our theory contributes to research on Developer Experience by providing a cognitive foundation for understanding troubleshooting difficulty, fatigue, and sustainability risk--and offers practical implications for both research and industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u75b2\u52b3\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c0827\u4f4d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5efa\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u75b2\u52b3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u75b2\u52b3\u3002"}}

Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects.

Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward.

However, evaluating these agents remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and the risk of LLM-as-judge bias. We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \\& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment.

Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u5f55\u50cf\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u5c0a\u91cd\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u6267\u6cd5\u516c\u4fe1\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u662f\u8b66\u65b9\u4e0e\u5e02\u6c11\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6267\u6cd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c0a\u91cd\u611f\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ecf\u5386\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9f\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3001LAPD\u57f9\u8bad\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u8c03\u7814\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7528\u4ee5\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u8bb0\u5f55\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6807\u8bb0\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u7406\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8b66\u65b9\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u53d7\u53f8\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u4e09\u7c7b\u6807\u8bb0\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u5747\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7406\u7531\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u7406\u7531\u7684\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u8bb0\u8005\u7406\u7531\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u7531\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6267\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u5143\u793e\u533a\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing truncation-based samplers are effective but largely heuristic, relying mainly on probability mass and entropy while ignoring semantic geometry of the token space. We present Top-W, a geometry-aware truncation rule that uses Wasserstein distance-defined over token-embedding geometry-to keep the cropped distribution close to the original, while explicitly balancing retained probability mass against the entropy of the kept set. Our theory yields a simple closed-form structure for the fixed-potential subset update: depending on the mass-entropy trade-off, the optimal crop either collapses to a single token or takes the form of a one-dimensional prefix that can be found efficiently with a linear scan. We implement Top-W using efficient geometry-based potentials (nearest-set or k-NN) and pair it with an alternating decoding routine that keeps the standard truncation-and-sampling interface unchanged. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (GSM8K, GPQA, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench) across three instruction-tuned models show that Top-W consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art decoding approaches achieving up to 33.7% improvement. Moreover, we find that Top-W not only improves accuracy-focused performance, but also boosts creativity under judge-based open-ended evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684Top-W\u622a\u65ad\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u5316token\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u622a\u65ad\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86token\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Top-W\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6f5c\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4ea4\u66ff\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u3001GPQA\u3001AlpacaEval\u548cMT-Bench\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cTop-W\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9876\u5c16\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe33.7%\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u521b\u9020\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Top-W\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9LLMware\u590d\u6742\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177LiAgent\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u8bb8\u53ef\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86LLMware\u751f\u6001\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7684LLMware\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceGitHub\u548cHugging Face\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5305\u542b\u5f00\u6e90\u4ed3\u5e93\u3001LLM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684LLMware\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8bb8\u53ef\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8bb8\u53ef\u76f8\u5173\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u8bb8\u53ef\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6LiAgent\u8fdb\u884c\u8bb8\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMware\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5F1\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0858%\u548c76%\uff09\uff0c\u800cLiAgent\u63d0\u5347\u523087%\u3002LiAgent\u62a5\u544a\u4e8660\u4e2a\u8bb8\u53ef\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d11\u4e2a\u5f97\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u4e0b\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f71\u54cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMware\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cLiAgent\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u7ea7\u8bb8\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u63a8\u52a8LLMware\u751f\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Diagnosing ASR Predictions in Sardinian via Layer-Wise Decoding", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent studies have shown that intermediate layers in multilingual speech models often encode more phonetically accurate representations than the final output layer. In this work, we apply a layer-wise decoding strategy to a pretrained Wav2Vec2 model to investigate how phoneme-level predictions evolve across encoder layers, focusing on Campidanese Sardinian, a low-resource language. We show that truncating upper transformer layers leads to improved Phoneme Error Rates (PER), with the best performance achieved not at the final layer, but two layers earlier. Through fine-grained alignment analysis, we find that intermediate predictions better preserve segmental identity, avoid overgeneration, and reduce certain classes of phonological errors. We also introduce the notion of regressive errors, cases where correct predictions at intermediate layers are overwritten by errors at the final layer. These regressions highlight the limitations of surface-level error metrics and reveal how deeper layers may generalize or abstract away from acoustic detail. Our findings support the use of early-layer probing as a diagnostic tool for ASR models, particularly in low-resource settings where standard evaluation metrics may fail to capture linguistically meaningful behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6bd4\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u9876\u5c42\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aASR\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u67e5\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Wav2Vec2\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u53d6\u6bcf\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\u574e\u76ae\u8fbe\u5185\u65af\u6492\u4e01\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u574e\u76ae\u8fbe\u5185\u65af\u6492\u4e01\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42transformer\u5c42\u540e\uff0c\u97f3\u7d20\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u800c\u662f\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u3002\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56de\u5f52\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u4e0a\u5c42transformer\u5c42\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u97f3\u7d20\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u97f3\u6bb5\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bed\u97f3\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations.

We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives.

Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality.

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\u0394R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\u03bc= 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\u03bc= 3.93$) and coherence ($\u03bc= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria. Our results demonstrate that satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured representations that can be operationalized for environmental and geospatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5730\u8868\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73af\u5883\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7269\u7406\u542b\u4e49\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75282017\u81f32023\u5e74\u671f\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u76841210\u4e07\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9Google AlphaEarth\u6a21\u578b\u768464\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e26\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u968f\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eFAISS\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u67e5\u8be2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2a\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u8868\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u6784\u591a\u6570\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff0812\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf$R^2 > 0.90$\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u7a0b\u63a5\u8fd1$R^2=0.97$\uff09\uff1b\u7ef4\u5ea6-\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65f6\u7a7a\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u571f\u5730\u8868\u9762\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728360\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u54cd\u5e94\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u8bc4\u52063.74/5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u768464\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u5730\u8868\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5730\u8868\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u60c5\u62a5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we conducted a five year longitudinal case study with Grundfos AB, in collaboration with the Software Centre in Sweden. RE principles were first derived through qualitative data collection spanning more than 25 sprints, approximately 320 weekly synchronisation meetings, and seven cross-company, company-specific workshops between 2019 and 2024. These activities engaged practitioners from diverse roles, representing several hundred developers across domains. In late 2024, five in depth focus groups with senior leaders at Grundfos provided retrospective validation of the principles and assessed their strategic impact. We aim to (1) empirically examine RE principles in large scale agile system development, (2) explore their benefits in practice within the case company, and (3) identify a set of transferable RE principles for large scale contexts. Using thematic analysis, six key RE principles architectural context, stakeholder-driven validation and alignment, requirements practices in large-scale agile organisations. evolution with lightweight documentation, delegated requirements management, organisational roles and responsibilities, and a shared understanding of requirements are derived. The study was further validated through crosscompany expert evaluation with three additional multinational organisations (Bosch, Ericsson, and Volvo Cars), which are directly responsible for largescale requirements management. Together, these efforts provide a scalable and adaptable foundation for improving requirements practices in largescale agile organisations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u6761\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec25\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4e0a\u51b2\u523a\u3001320\u6b21\u6bcf\u5468\u540c\u6b65\u4f1a\u8bae\u3001\u4e03\u6b21\u516c\u53f8\u95f4\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u671f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u516c\u53f8\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u516d\u6761\u5173\u952e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u67b6\u6784\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u3001\u59d4\u6258\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u804c\u8d23\u4ee5\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e1a\u5185\u591a\u5bb6\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u5e74\u7eb5\u5411\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u516d\u6761\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u534f\u540c\u3002"}}

These characteristics cause agents to frequently encounter unseen scenarios and distribution shifts, making continual learning in specific environments essential for computer-use agents (CUAs). However, a key challenge lies in obtaining high-quality and environment-grounded agent data without relying on costly human annotation. In this work, we introduce ACuRL, an Autonomous Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that continually adapts agents to specific environments with zero human data. The agent first explores target environments to acquire initial experiences. During subsequent iterative training, a curriculum task generator leverages these experiences together with feedback from the previous iteration to synthesize new tasks tailored for the agent's current capabilities. To provide reliable reward signals, we introduce CUAJudge, a robust automatic evaluator for CUAs that achieves 93% agreement with human judgments. Empirically, our method effectively enables both intra-environment and cross-environment continual learning, yielding 4-22% performance gains without catastrophic forgetting on existing environments. Further analyses show highly sparse updates (e.g., 20% parameters), which helps explain the effective and robust adaptation.

Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFeatureBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7279\u6027\u7ea7\u8de8\u63d0\u4ea4/PR\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u6267\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u6d3e\u751f\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\u548cPR\u7684\u7279\u6027\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b200\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u548c3825\u4e2a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7684FeatureBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4ed3\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a11.0%\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709SWE-bench\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "FeatureBench\u57fa\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u6027\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ea\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6\u4fdd\u5b88\u5f03\u6743\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u5f20\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u9762\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u8bc1\u636e\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff08SAE\u548cSRE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5206\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5206\u89e3\u624d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u4e3b\u5f20\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u5f0f\u6bd4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3b\u5f20\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u4e3b\u5f20\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u4f46\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u2018\u5f03\u6743\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002"}}

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components.

This gap is especially critical in finance, where documents mix dense regulatory text, numerical tables, and visual charts, and where extraction errors can have real-world consequences. We introduce Multimodal Finance Eval, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating French financial document understanding. The dataset contains 1,204 expert-validated questions spanning text extraction, table comprehension, chart interpretation, and multi-turn conversational reasoning, drawn from real investment prospectuses, KIDs, and PRIIPs. We evaluate six open-weight VLMs (8B-124B parameters) using an LLM-as-judge protocol. While models achieve strong performance on text and table tasks (85-90% accuracy), they struggle with chart interpretation (34-62%). Most notably, multi-turn dialogue reveals a sharp failure mode: early mistakes propagate across turns, driving accuracy down to roughly 50% regardless of model size.\n  These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis. Multimodal Finance Eval offers a challenging benchmark to measure and drive progress in this high-stakes setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6cd5\u8bed\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u91d1\u878d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8868\u683c\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6d4b\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u8bed\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Multimodal Finance Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523085-90%\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec534-62%\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8868\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}}

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer.

We show that our levels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall during the day -- highest at 8am (in-line with when we have high cortisol levels in the body) and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them).

This paper introduces a novel, LLM-assisted interactive tool designed to reduce the gap between scalable automation and the rigorous precision required for expert human judgment. Unlike traditional statistical aligners, our system employs a template-based Prompt Manager that leverages large language models (LLMs) for sentence segmentation and alignment under strict JSON output constraints. In this tool, automated preprocessing integrates into a human-in-the-loop workflow, allowing researchers to refine alignments and apply custom translation technique annotations through a stand-off architecture.

In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy.

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone.

In this work, we propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework for KE-based detoxification that examines its reliability beyond standard classifier-based metrics along three dimensions: optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness. We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations.

Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings.

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRU-Mem\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14MemAgent\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5185\u5b58\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GRU-Mem\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95e8\u673a\u5236\uff08\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u9000\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "GRU-Mem\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eMemAgent\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a\u8fbe400%\u3002", "conclusion": "GRU-Mem\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRNN\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates.

Rethinking Attention Masking for User Representation Learning", "comment": "13 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Decoder-only large language models are increasingly used as behavioral encoders for user representation learning, yet the impact of attention masking on the quality of user embeddings remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution.

In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores.

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly.

H. Ngai"], "title": "Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment for Domain-Adaptive VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities.

The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLSCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u767d\u76d2LLM\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5408\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u53catoken\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u652f\u6301token\u6982\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684LLM\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLSCL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0token\u6982\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1LSCL\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LSCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e2e\u52a9\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

How ANN, CNN, and RNN perform in NLI-Native Language Identification", "comment": "16 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Native Language Identification (NLI) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that typically determines the native language of an author through their writing or a speaker through their speaking. It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewl\u00eari, a subdialect spoken in Hewl\u00ear (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewl\u00eari speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme.

However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinMMEval 2026\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91d1\u878d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u91d1\u878d\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u8bed\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u91d1\u878d\u8003\u8bd5\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u91d1\u878d\u95ee\u7b54\uff08PolyFiQA\uff09\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u91d1\u878d\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91d1\u878dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "FinMMEval 2026\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025).

However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u662f\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u53d9\u4e8b\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u969c\u788d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aA\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6a2a\u65ad\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u8bbf\u8c08\uff1bB\uff09\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u81ea\u4f20\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff1bC\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u91cf\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u81ea\u4f20\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bbf\u8c08\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u5728\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u8bcd\u6c47\u5e26\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65ad\u7eed\u6027\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53d9\u4e8b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u4f20\u800c\u975e\u865a\u6784\u6545\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5176\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5SOAR\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u65f6\u6269\u5927\u641c\u7d22\u8303\u56f4\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u65e9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dream-7B\u548cLLaDA-8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cSOAR\u5728GSM8K\u3001MBPP\u3001HumanEval\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SOAR\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRA-Squeeze\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u518d\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LoRA\u79e9\u9884\u8bbe\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u9762\u4e34\u79e9\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u8bbe\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u79e9\u6a21\u5757\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79e9\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u9ad8\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3(RSVD)\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u79e9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u540e\u671f\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u964d\u79e9\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u548c10\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLoRA-Squeeze\u7684\u540e\u671f\u538b\u7f29\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u964d\u79e9\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA-Squeeze\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u79e9\u89e3\u518d\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LoRA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.\n  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.\n  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.\n  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation.

We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u6839\u636e\u671f\u671b\u8f93\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u63a8\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LM\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a10\u548c80\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a20\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u767d\u76d2LM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning.

We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks.

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence.

A key lever is the \\emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \\emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B.

Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains. In addition to domain labels, each prompt is classified with one of three orthogonal semantic types-object, attribute, or relations misalignment-using Gemma-2-9B-it and expanded via Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 with SimHash-based fingerprinting to avoid deduplication.

But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix (\"Wait, think safely\") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeThink\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ed5\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "SafeThink\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\uff0c\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u77ed\u6821\u6b63\u524d\u7f00\u201cWait, think safely\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u6062\u590d\u89c6\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "SafeThink\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8630-60%\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982LlamaV-o1\u6a21\u578b\u5728JailbreakV-28K\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece63.33%\u964d\u81f35.74%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeThink\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u8bb0\u5fc6\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528token\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u5373\u66f4\u591a\u72ec\u7279\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u5355\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AIME'24/25\u548cGPQA\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5355\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u534712-26\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4e14\u65e0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3token\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u8bb0\u5fc6\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406SFT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
