We introduce the Women's Health Benchmark (WHB), the first benchmark evaluating LLM performance specifically in women's health. Our benchmark comprises 96 rigorously validated model stumps covering five medical specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, primary care, oncology, and neurology), three query types (patient query, clinician query, and evidence/policy query), and eight error types (dosage/medication errors, missing critical information, outdated guidelines/treatment recommendations, incorrect treatment advice, incorrect factual information, missing/incorrect differential diagnosis, missed urgency, and inappropriate recommendations). We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art LLMs and revealed alarming gaps: current models show approximately 60\\% failure rates on the women's health benchmark, with performance varying dramatically across specialties and error types. Notably, models universally struggle with \"missed urgency\" indicators, while newer models like GPT-5 show significant improvements in avoiding inappropriate recommendations.

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u793a\u8303\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u53d6\u820d\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStruct-SQL\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u793a\u8303\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u53478.1%\u3002\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Text-to-SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model.

Chudziak"], "title": "On the Role of Contextual Information and Ego States in LLM Agent Behavior for Transactional Analysis Dialogues", "comment": "Presented at the 39th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 39)", "summary": "LLM-powered agents are now used in many areas, from customer support to education, and there is increasing interest in their ability to act more like humans. This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior.

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8003\u8651\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684F1\u6307\u6807(W-F1)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5206\u5272\u9897\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u533a\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u9897\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u683cF1\u5f97\u5206\u504f\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u9009\u53d6\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9897\u7c92\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8fb9\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08MAPPO\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\uff08LCR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fdb\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MAPPO\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u90bb\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6267\u884c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660eMAPPO-LCR\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aMAPPO\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0cMAPPO\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Camera ready version presented at an international IEEE conference. Final version to appear in 2026", "summary": "Microservice based systems underpin modern distributed computing environments but remain vulnerable to partial failures, cascading timeouts, and inconsistent recovery behavior. Although numerous resilience and recovery patterns have been proposed, existing surveys are largely descriptive and lack systematic evidence synthesis or quantitative rigor. This paper presents a PRISMA aligned systematic literature review of empirical studies on microservice recovery strategies published between 2014 and 2025 across IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus. From an initial corpus of 412 records, 26 high quality studies were selected using transparent inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria. The review identifies nine recurring resilience themes encompassing circuit breakers, retries with jitter and budgets, sagas with compensation, idempotency, bulkheads, adaptive backpressure, observability, and chaos validation. As a data oriented contribution, the paper introduces a Recovery Pattern Taxonomy, a Resilience Evaluation Score checklist for standardized benchmarking, and a constraint aware decision matrix mapping latency, consistency, and cost trade offs to appropriate recovery mechanisms. The results consolidate fragmented resilience research into a structured and analyzable evidence base that supports reproducible evaluation and informed design of fault tolerant and performance aware microservice systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e862014-2025\u5e74\u95f4\u5173\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e5d\u5927\u6062\u590d\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u90e8\u5206\u6545\u969c\u3001\u7ea7\u8054\u8d85\u65f6\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PRISMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4eceIEEE Xplore\u3001ACM\u548cScopus\u4e2d\u7b5b\u90092014-2025\u5e74\u95f4412\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u53d626\u7bc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5305\u62ec\u65ad\u8def\u5668\u3001\u5e26\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8bd5\u3001\u5e26\u8865\u507f\u7684Saga\u3001\u5e42\u7b49\u6027\u3001\u9694\u8231\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80cc\u538b\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u548c\u6743\u8861\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u9519\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u77e5\u60c5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

The use of an automatic conversational agent would improve engagement by ensuring that all user comments receive a timely response.). We address the challenge of insufficient high-quality data by employing a two-level data augmentation strategy: synthetic data augmentation and real data augmentation. First, we fine-tuned an open source LLM to classify posts from our existing smoking cessation support groups and identify intents with low F1 (precision+recall) scores. Then, for these intents, we generate additional synthetic data using prompt engineering with the GPT model, with an average of 87\\% of the generated synthetic posts deemed high quality by human annotators. Overall, the synthetic augmentation process resulted in 43\\% of the original posts being selected for augmentation, followed by 140\\% synthetic expansion of these posts. Additionally, we scraped more than 10,000 real posts from a related online support context, of which 73\\% were validated as good quality by human annotators. Each synthetic or scraped post underwent rigorous validation involving human reviewers to ensure quality and relevance. The validated new data, combined with the original support group posts, formed an augmented dataset used to retrain the intent classifier. Performance evaluation of the retrained model demonstrated a 32\\% improvement in F1, confirming the effectiveness of our data augmentation approach. Synthetic and real post augmentation led to similar performance improvements.

We introduce OPERA (Observability, Provable Execution, Red-team, Attestation), a benchmark suite and evaluation protocol designed to measure (i) detectability of misalignment, (ii) time to detection under stealthy strategies, and (iii) resilience of verifiability mechanisms to adversarial prompt and persona injection.

However, little is known about how developers actually use TEEs in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of real-world TEE applications. We collected and analyzed 241 open-source projects from GitHub that utilize the two most widely-adopted TEEs, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. By combining manual inspection with customized static analysis scripts, we examined their adoption contexts, usage patterns, and development practices across three phases. First, we categorized the projects into 8 application domains and identified trends in TEE adoption over time. We found that the dominant use case is IoT device security (30%), which contrasts sharply with prior academic focus on blockchain and cryptographic systems (7%), while AI model protection (12%) is rapidly emerging as a growing domain. Second, we analyzed how TEEs are integrated into software and observed that 32.4% of the projects reimplement cryptographic functionalities instead of using official SDK APIs, suggesting that current SDKs may have limited usability and portability to meet developers' practical needs. Third, we examined security practices through manual inspection and found that 25.3% (61 of 241) of the projects exhibit insecure coding behaviors when using TEEs, such as hardcoded secrets and missing input validation, which undermine their intended security guarantees. Our findings have important implications for improving the usability of TEE SDKs and supporting developers in trusted software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9241\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528Intel SGX\u548cARM TrustZone\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86TEE\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u4e3b\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u5bc6\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7f16\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9TEE\uff08\u5982Intel SGX\u548cARM TrustZone\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u72b6\u51b5\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2dTEE\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e86241\u4e2aGitHub\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u52a0\u5bc6\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7f16\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0830%\uff09\uff0cAI\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u62a4\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff1b32.4%\u9879\u76ee\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u5bc6\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660eSDK\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b25.3%\u9879\u76ee\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5bc6\u94a5\u7b49\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7f16\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709TEE SDK\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u643a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3aTEE\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u4fe1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\uff08ELN\uff09\u8868\u793a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\uff0c\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5982Whisper\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210Whisper-large\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u76845\u4e2a\u6700\u4f73\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5229\u7528ELN\u91cf\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684ELN\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLaMA-2-7B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "ELN\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4ece31.10%\u964d\u4f4e\u523024.84%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0ELN\u768430.79%\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b64.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The gold standard is user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) or behavioral signals (e.g., retention), but these are often scarce in prototypes and research projects, or too-slow to use for system optimization. We present AutoMetrics, a framework for synthesizing evaluation metrics under low-data constraints. AutoMetrics combines retrieval from MetricBank, a collection of 48 metrics we curate, with automatically generated LLM-as-a-Judge criteria informed by lightweight human feedback. These metrics are composed via regression to maximize correlation with human signal. AutoMetrics takes you from expensive measures to interpretable automatic metrics. Across 5 diverse tasks, AutoMetrics improves Kendall correlation with human ratings by up to 33.4% over LLM-as-a-Judge while requiring fewer than 100 feedback points. We show that AutoMetrics can be used as a proxy reward to equal effect as a verifiable reward.

This study explores how LLMs are being misused in software engineering surveys and investigates the methodological implications of such behavior for data authenticity, validity, and research integrity. We collected data from two survey deployments conducted in 2025 through the Prolific platform and analyzed the content of participants' answers to identify irregular or falsified responses. A subset of responses suspected of being AI generated was examined through qualitative pattern inspection, narrative characterization, and automated detection using the Scribbr AI Detector. The analysis revealed recurring structural patterns in 49 survey responses indicating synthetic authorship, including repetitive sequencing, uniform phrasing, and superficial personalization. These false narratives mimicked coherent reasoning while concealing fabricated content, undermining construct, internal, and external validity. Our study identifies data authenticity as an emerging dimension of validity in software engineering surveys. We emphasize that reliable evidence now requires combining automated and interpretive verification procedures, transparent reporting, and community standards to detect and prevent AI generated responses, thereby protecting the credibility of surveys in software engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u9020\u5047\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u89e3\u8bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u8c03\u67e5\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u4f2a\u9020\u8c03\u67e5\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72025\u5e74\u5728Prolific\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u548cScribbr AI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7591\u4f3cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b049\u4efd\u56de\u7b54\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u7528\u8bed\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80a4\u6d45\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u4f46\u5185\u5bb9\u9020\u5047\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u6784\u5ff5\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6548\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8c03\u67e5\u6548\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u900f\u660e\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9632\u6b62AI\u751f\u6210\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2.

Prior research has typically examined single issues such as class imbalance or feature irrelevance in isolation, overlooking that real-world data problems frequently co-occur and interact. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical analysis in SDP that simultaneously examines five co-occurring data quality issues (class imbalance, class overlap, irrelevant features, attribute noise, and outliers) across 374 datasets and five classifiers. We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.\n  Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.\n  By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research.

Understanding Smart Contract Semantics and Interactions in the NFT Ecosystem", "comment": null, "summary": "The NFT ecosystem represents an interconnected, decentralized environment that encompasses the creation, distribution, and trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where key actors, such as marketplaces, sellers, and buyers, utilize smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless transactions. Scam tokens are deliberately created to mislead users and facilitate financial exploitation, posing significant risks in the NFT ecosystem. Prior work has explored the NFT ecosystem from various perspectives, including security challenges, actor behaviors, and risks from scams and wash trading, leaving a gap in understanding the semantics and interactions of smart contracts during transactions, and how the risks associated with scam tokens manifest in relation to the semantics and interactions of contracts. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on smart contract semantics and interactions in the NFT ecosystem, using a curated dataset of nearly 100 million transactions across 20 million blocks on Ethereum. We observe a limited semantic diversity among smart contracts in the NFT ecosystem, dominated by proxy, token, and DeFi contracts. Marketplace and proxy registry contracts are the most frequently involved in smart contract interactions during transactions, engaging with a broad spectrum of contracts in the ecosystem. Token contracts exhibit bytecode-level diversity, whereas scam tokens exhibit bytecode convergence. Certain interaction patterns between smart contracts are common to both risky and non-risky transactions, while others are predominantly associated with risky transactions.

To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.\n  We present 12 key results.

This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales.

However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources.

Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in socially grounded tasks, but their capacity for cross-cultural ToM reasoning is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels. The resulting dataset covers diverse theory of mind facets such as mental state attribution, false belief reasoning, non-literal communication, social norm violations, perspective coordination, and multi-agent reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CulturalToM-VQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6587\u5316\u7ebf\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba15095\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u7b5b\u9009\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316ToM\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u7c7bToM\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5f52\u56e0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u975e\u5b57\u9762\u4ea4\u6d41\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6587\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5fc3\u667a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "CulturalToM-VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u91ce\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u8bef\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u91c7\u7528\u4e86BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u3001ELECTRA\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53c2\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6F1\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8693.5%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5305\u62ecFalcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u3001Phi\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff08\u603b\u53c2\u6570595M\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eLlama 3.3 70B\u751f\u6210\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u5927\u4e94\u7279\u8d28\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0e\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Research efforts on the topic have so far relied on the SimulEval repository, which is no longer maintained and does not support systems that revise their outputs. In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems. Designed for long-form speech processing, it supports not only incremental decoding approaches, but also re-translation methods, enabling for their comparison within the same framework both in terms of quality and latency. In addition, it also offers an interactive web interface to demo any system built within the tool.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86simulstream\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6f14\u793a\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f51\u9875\u6f14\u793a\u754c\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SimulEval\u5e93\u5df2\u505c\u6b62\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u957f\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fbf\u6377\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bd1\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fasimulstream\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u589e\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u91cd\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f51\u9875\u6f14\u793a\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "simulstream\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8bd1\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u65b9\u4fbf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "simulstream\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ca\u6f14\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to \"peek into the future\" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list. Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity.

Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art accuracy, we compare Laplace approximations against maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates to highlight uncertainty calibration and selective prediction.

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines.

The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters.

To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models.

Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.
