### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于变换器的DeBERTa-KC模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识构建水平，取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动知识构建分类方法在处理话语中的复杂知识建构层级时效果有限，且存在类别不平衡和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 基于DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术，针对四类知识构建标签进行平衡训练，构建了包含2万个标注样本的平衡语料库，并实现了完整的端到端流水线。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC模型取得了宏F1分数0.836±0.008，显著优于传统和其他变换器基线模型，特别在捕捉高阶知识构建层级（探索和协商）表现优异。

Conclusion: 大规模语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微特征，支持基于理论的规模化话语分析和知识参与度的自动化评估工具开发。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种主流大语言模型生成的高中物理课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，测试了三种提示框架。结果显示，模型对语言可读性影响最大，DeepSeek表现最佳；提示框架对准确性和教学完整性影响显著，RACE框架表现优异。整体学习目标集中在记忆和理解层级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同大语言模型及提示框架对AI生成课程计划质量的影响，提升教学计划的实用性和可靠性。

Method: 基于五大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15份包含电磁波谱主题的高中物理课程计划，采用四项自动化指标进行分析：语言可读性、事实准确性、课程标准符合度及认知需求。

Result: 模型选择对语言可读性影响最大，DeepSeek最具可读性，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架在减少幻觉内容和课程标准对齐方面表现最好；所有学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆认知分类的记忆和理解层。

Conclusion: 语言模型设计主要决定文本可读性，提示框架则影响教学计划的准确性和课程对齐。最佳方案是结合优化可读性的模型、RACE提示框架及明确的物理概念和高阶目标清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff引入了一种基于修正的离散扩散模型训练方法，通过两阶段训练和自我纠正机制，有效解决了生成中错误级联的问题，显著提升生成内容的连贯性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散扩散模型在训练与推理不一致时会产生错误级联，导致生成结果存在语法和语义错误，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了ReDiff框架，通过两阶段训练（合成错误的修正训练和在线自我纠正训练）来教会模型主动辨识并修正自身错误，打破错误级联。

Result: ReDiff在大量实验中表现出更佳的生成连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: 通过主动修正机制，ReDiff有效提升了离散扩散模型的生成质量，为视觉语言任务中的生成问题提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Sparse Tracing技术，通过Stream算法实现对百万级长上下文的稀疏注意力分析，显著降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机械可解释性方法在处理百万级长上下文时计算资源需求过高，内存消耗达TB级，难以实现高效分析。

Method: 提出动态稀疏注意力机制和基于层次剪枝的Stream算法，利用近线性时间复杂度和线性空间复杂度筛选最重要的注意力块，保持模型的下一词行为。

Result: 在长链思维推理和RULER基准测试中，Stream能有效保留重要信息路径，舍弃绝大多数无关注意力交互，准确识别思维锚点和检索路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing使得长上下文可解释性分析在普通GPU上成为可能，极大降低了资源门槛，方便链式思维监测的普及与应用。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种利用大语言模型分析电子健康记录中的非结构化文本，筛选高风险HIV患者的方法，实验验证准确率高且假阴性率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然使用结构化数据的机器学习方法在HIV诊断中已有应用，但忽视了临床笔记等非结构化文本中潜藏的重要信息。

Method: 设计了一种利用大语言模型处理非结构化电子健康记录文本的流程，用于判定患者是否应进行进一步的HIV检测。

Result: 在鹿特丹厄勒姆斯大学医学中心的临床数据上，该方法表现出高准确率和较低的假阴性率。

Conclusion: 结合大语言模型分析非结构化文本可以有效提升HIV筛查的准确性，有助于实现更高效的早期诊断和传染控制。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次基于专家评审对大型语言模型（LLMs）在生命周期评估（LCA）中的表现进行系统评估，揭示了其准确性和解释质量的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对LLMs在LCA应用中的标准化评价框架和系统证据，且LCA领域无明确共识协议，需评估LLMs的可靠性和实用性。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLMs，涵盖商用与开源模型，针对22个LCA相关任务，由17名LCA专家基于科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性及遵从指令等标准进行168次专家评审。

Result: 37%回答包含不准确信息，解释质量多为中等或良好，格式遵守较好，幻觉现象显著，部分模型引用错误率高达40%。开源模型表现不亚于闭源模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在LCA中存在盲目使用风险，但对提升解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度有益，建议引入基于事实的机制以提升应用可靠性。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于游戏的评估方法来综合评估多模态大型语言模型的能力，使用卡牌游戏Dixit进行具体体现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型的评估依赖静态基准测试或主观的人类/模型对比，这存在不能综合评估模型能力、主观昂贵且模型可能利用表面特征提升表现的问题。

Method: 作者提出用游戏作为评估工具，利用游戏多项能力的综合应用、客观固定的规则和竞争性，具体采用Dixit游戏，通过玩家为卡牌生成提示词让部分玩家误选卡牌的机制评估模型能力。

Result: 在五个多模态大型语言模型上的实验表明，Dixit游戏的胜率排名与主流评测基准完全相关，同时游戏中人机对战展示了模型策略的差异和推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法为多模态大型语言模型提供了一个全面、客观、强健且更具交互性的评估框架，揭示了模型在推理等方面的不足，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的应用，评估其在四个运筹学基准测试上的表现，并提出多种策略减少虚假生成，提高模型生成的数学模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学优化依赖专家将复杂现实问题转化为数学模型，过程繁琐且依赖领域知识。现有语言模型成本较高且容易产生错误，限制了其在供应链优化中的实际应用。

Method: 选取成本效益高且表现优异的DeepSeek-R1模型，通过基线测试和构建虚假生成分类体系，结合少样本学习、多智能体框架、工具调用和LLM作为评判者等技术，系统评估并提升其运筹学问题的建模能力。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在四个运筹学基准测试（NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP、ComplexOR）中表现良好，所采用的多种策略有效减少了模型的虚假生成，提高了数学问题建模的准确性和与用户意图的匹配度。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1作为一种成本效益高、性能优异的语言模型，在运筹学优化建模中展现出较好的应用潜力，结合合理的策略能进一步提升模型的实用性和可靠性，为决策支持系统提供新的技术路径。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的无参数更新学习框架，通过记忆增强和批评生成，提高分类任务的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，作者希望通过无参数更新且高效透明的方式提升模型性能。

Method: 设计了一个记忆增强框架，结合情景记忆存储实例级批评和语义记忆提炼任务级指导，并引入了新度量“易建议性”解释模型行为。

Result: 在多任务上引入批评后，准确率相较只用标签的检索基线提升最高达24.8%，并发现了OpenAI模型与开源模型对事实型和偏好型数据的不同处理方式。

Conclusion: 基于记忆驱动的反思学习框架可显著增强大语言模型的适应性和解释性，为构建更智能可解释的LLM代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR提出了一种无监督的歌词翻译新框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略提升翻译质量和训练效率，在英汉歌词翻译任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以处理段落级跨行连贯性和押韵等音乐约束。

Method: LyriCAR引入难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，逐步引导模型学习更复杂的挑战，提高训练效率和翻译质量。

Result: LyriCAR在英汉歌词翻译任务中，超越多项翻译指标和多维度奖励分数，训练步数减少近40%，表现优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升歌词翻译的连贯性和押韵质量，实现高效训练与翻译性能提升，适合无监督歌词翻译任务。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将大型语言模型（LLMs）与符号自然语言理解（NLU）系统结合的混合方法，以弥补各自的不足，实现更精确的推理和更广泛的覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型应用广泛，但因依赖概率推理，容易出现事实幻觉和输出不一致等问题；符号NLU系统则依赖人工知识库，覆盖有限但解释性强且易于推理和调试。

Method: 利用LLMs进行文本改写和简化以扩大覆盖面，同时用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取数量和因果关系的任务中，混合方法显著优于单纯的符号NLU管道。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs的广覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化推理能力的混合方法能够有效提升自然语言理解的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言句子解析成依存树的基础算法，逐词解析，复杂度为$O(n^3)$。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种模拟人脑处理语言特性的依存句法解析算法。

Method: 逐词操作，实时附加单词，类似于短语结构解析但行为更贴近人类。

Result: 算法最坏情况下复杂度为$O(n^3)$，但实际语言使用中最坏情况出现频率低。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论复杂度与人类语言特性间取得平衡，适合语言解析任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一范式来评估大语言模型在临床决策中的应用，强调了临床背景和问题维度，并扩展了评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗数据集如MedQA简化了临床问答，未能真实反映临床决策复杂性，需建立更全面的评估标准。

Method: 通过构建临床背景和临床问题两个维度的统一范式，综述现有数据集设置和方法，探讨训练与测试技术，扩展评估指标至效率和可解释性。

Result: 提出的范式能够系统化比较模型表现，帮助识别不同方法的适用场景，并引入多维度评估推动实际临床应用。

Conclusion: 该统一范式澄清了假设，规范了比较方法，促进临床意义明确的大语言模型的发展，同时指出未来挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

### [14] [ToolScope: Enhancing LLM Agent Tool Use through Tool Merging and Context-Aware Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20036)
*Marianne Menglin Liu,Daniel Garcia,Fjona Parllaku,Vikas Upadhyay,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ToolScope，以解决大语言模型工具选择中的冗余和上下文限制问题，通过自动合并和选择相关工具，提升工具选择准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型依赖外部工具完成复杂任务，但工具集存在冗余和名称描述重叠，导致选择模糊且准确率降低；同时模型输入上下文有限，难以高效处理大型工具集。

Method: 提出ToolScope，包括ToolScopeMerger（自动审计和修正工具合并，减少冗余）和ToolScopeRetriever（为每个查询排名并选择最相关工具，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制）。

Result: 在三种最先进的大语言模型和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，ToolScope使工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope有效优化了大型语言模型的工具使用，提升了工具选择的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit

TL;DR: 本文针对现代希腊语尤其是法律领域中文本处理受限于模型架构和数据资源的问题，提出了一套基于高质量数据构建的新型希腊语Transformer模型，并引入双语希腊-英语法律嵌入模型，显著提升了下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代希腊语作为形态丰富的中等资源语言，在自然语言处理中面临研究分散、架构单一及上下文长度受限等问题，尤其在法律等专业领域，现有模型多基于早期Transformer，无法有效处理长文档。

Method: 构建大规模、经过严格质量过滤的希腊语通用及专业法律语料库，基于这些数据预训练并系统评估多种现代Transformer架构（如ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT），同时提出首个针对法律领域的希腊-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 新模型在多个下游任务中表现优异，尤其是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT显著优于现有基线，验证了数据驱动、多样化架构和双语设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据构建及引入多样化现代Transformer架构，建立了适用于现代希腊语及法律领域的新型语言模型，提升了处理长文本和专业领域任务的能力，为希腊语自然语言处理提供了重要资源和方法。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Motivation: 传统预训练模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习仍存在提升空间，尤其是在跨领域事件触发检测和自回归大语言模型结构上的表现限制。

Method: 提出多任务模型结合额外信号、对自回归大语言模型进行架构改造以实现双向信息流，以及利用生成式监督上下文微调结合响应导向适应策略的序列标注框架。

Result: 经过上述方法适应的预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务上表现出最佳性能，特别是在事件触发检测的跨领域迁移学习效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 针对性迁移学习范式的引入有效提升了预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的适应能力和性能，验证了方法的实用价值。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对波斯语等资源匮乏语言的专业领域应用，特别是医疗问答，提升小型语言模型的推理能力十分关键。

Method: 采用强化学习与人工智能反馈（RLAIF）与直接偏好优化（DPO），通过生成被拒绝与优选答案对训练模型，利用链式思维（CoT）形成正确和错误推理路径的数据集进行训练。

Result: 训练出的模型在波斯语医疗推理能力上显著优于先前用大量数据训练的模型，显示了有效性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 推理能力导向的训练方法在有限数据条件下，有助于开发特定领域高效语言模型。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CreativityPrism，一个针对大语言模型创造力的综合评估框架，将创造力分为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，涵盖九个任务和三个领域，并通过20种指标进行测量。评估结果显示专有模型普遍优于开源模型，不同任务和维度间关联性差异明显，强调创造力需多维度整体评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型创造力的评估缺乏统一框架，现有方法碎片化且因定义和测量标准不同而存在较大差异，亟需建立涵盖多场景的整体评估框架。

Method: 提出CreativityPrism框架，将创造力划分为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，设计涉及发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域内共九个任务，采用二十种任务特定指标进行综合评价，并对17个开源及专有模型进行测评及性能相关性分析。

Result: 评测显示专有模型表现优于开源模型，同一领域内任务表现相关性强，不同领域表现相关性弱；质量和多样性指标相关性高，而新颖性相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 模型在某一创造力任务或维度上的优异表现不代表整体优势，需采用多维度、跨领域的综合框架全面评价大语言模型的创造力。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: 该文提出了名为ARTER的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和有针对性的实体推理，在不进行深度微调的情况下提升实体链接性能，同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和深度微调，或者使用大语言模型推理但计算成本高昂，效率低下。作者希望在保证性能的同时提高效率。

Method: ARTER结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和有选择的推理，使用少量互补信号判断实体难度，将易处理的实体交给低计算成本的链接器处理，难处理的实体则利用较昂贵的大语言模型进行定向推理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER在5个数据集上相比ReFinED提升最高4.47%，平均提升2.53%，性能与完全基于大语言模型推理的方法相当，但计算效率提升两倍。

Conclusion: ARTER有效平衡了实体链接的效果和计算成本，通过分级处理和定向推理，实现了高性能和高效率的实体链接。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BoundRL的方法，用于长结构化文本的分段和标签预测，通过定位起始标记而非完整生成段落，显著降低推理成本并减少幻觉，同时采用带可验证奖励的强化学习和中间候选生成提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本变得越来越复杂，传统的句子或段落级分段方法难以有效处理包含表格、代码片段等元素的长结构化文本，迫切需要一种新的分段方法。

Method: BoundRL联合执行token级文本分段和标签预测，通过生成起始标记序列并在原文中定位以重构完整内容，采用带有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）优化文档重构质量和语义一致性，并通过系统扰动生成中间候选以避免熵崩溃和提升解的质量。

Result: 在复杂提示的长结构化文本上，使用1.7B参数的小型语言模型，BoundRL在性能上优于大模型的few-shot提示，RLVR相比监督微调有显著提升，加入中间候选进一步增强了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL有效提升了长结构化文本的分段和标签预测效果，显著降低推理成本，减少幻觉，强化学习和中间候选机制显著提高了模型性能和泛化能力，适合处理复杂多样的结构化文本场景。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因训练数据继承了刻板印象，导致对某些社会群体存在偏见，而在立场检测任务中，此类偏见评估被忽视。

Method: 在零样本设置下，通过自动标注预先存在的立场检测数据集，添加语言方言和文本复杂度两个属性，分析属性对模型立场判定的影响。

Result: 发现大语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出显著刻板印象，如将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言错误关联为反对特朗普。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在立场检测中存在严重偏见，需要引起重视和针对性改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的搜索代理无法同时实现深度推理和大规模信息收集，这限制了其在实际应用中的效果。

Method: 设计DeepWideSearch基准，包含220个跨15个领域的问题，要求代理处理大量数据并执行多跳推理。

Result: 即使是最先进的代理在该基准上的平均成功率只有2.39%，并揭示了四种主要失败模式。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch揭示了当前代理架构的关键限制，为未来开发更强大、稳健的信息搜索代理提供了研究基础。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流程和强化学习的方法能有效提升表格理解和推理能力，具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在处理空间推理和计算任务时的能力及其局限。

Method: 设计五个基于网格的任务，逐步增加复杂度，测试模型在象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、寻找字词及拼图滑动等任务中的表现。

Result: 模型在小规模任务上表现适中，但随着任务复杂度和规模增加，准确率平均下降42.7%，最高降幅达到84%，显示空间推理能力不足。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型缺乏稳健的空间表示能力，语言理解与空间推理之间存在显著差距，需进一步研究语言与几何结合的能力提升。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码的采样策略，用于对语言模型输出的所有可能分词进行边际概率估计，以提升推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型在推理时只统计单一分词的概率，忽视了同一文本的多种分词可能性，导致评估不全面。直接边际化计算量大，采样生成又成本高昂，需寻找高效的估计方法。

Method: 本文提出无需实际生成文本的采样策略，利用模型和分词器无关的廉价采样方式，快速近似估计所有可能分词的概率边际值。

Result: 实验表明，该策略在保持较高准确率的同时，大幅降低运行时间，适用于多种公开模型。

Conclusion: 解码自由的采样策略有效提升了边际概率计算的速度和准确性，可用于下游推理任务，提高语言模型的评估与应用效率。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种融合文本、音频和面部信号的三模态情感严重程度评估框架，用于同时诊断抑郁症和PTSD，实现跨障碍的严重度分级诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自动评估方法多为二元和特定障碍，难以同时评估抑郁症和PTSD的严重程度，且缺乏临床决策支持的解释性。需要一种能够融合多模态信息并提供跨障碍严重度估计和决策解释的统一框架。

Method: 提出一个三模态融合框架，将访谈文本的句子级Transformer嵌入、音频的对数Mel统计特征及其差分、面部动作单元、视线、头部及姿态描述符进行同步和融合，使用校准的晚期融合分类器输出抑郁症（5类别）和PTSD（3类别）的严重度等级及特征级归因。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上进行分层交叉验证，三模态融合模型相较于单一模态和消融模型表现更优。融合模型在准确率和加权F1分数上与最强单模态持平，但提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的稳健性。具体而言，PTSD的回归误差减少，分类一致性提升。消融实验显示文本对抑郁严重度贡献最大，音频和面部特征对PTSD诊断至关重要。

Conclusion: 该三模态严重度融合方法为抑郁症和PTSD的联合自动化诊断提供了可重复的评估方式和临床医生参与的决策支持，提升了跨障碍的严重度识别能力和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ContextLM的新框架，通过引入下一个上下文预测目标，提升了大语言模型对多标记上下文的预测能力，从而增强模型捕捉语义结构和长程上下文的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型采用逐标记预测，限制了模型捕捉更高层次语义结构和长程上下文关系的能力。

Method: ContextLM框架在标准预训练基础上增加了下一上下文预测任务，训练模型预测多个未来标记的表征，同时保持与传统自回归逐标记评估方法兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型（最大15亿参数）上进行广泛实验，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均表现出稳定提升。

Conclusion: 下一上下文预测为提升语言模型表现提供了一条可扩展且高效的途径，能够增强长程连贯性和注意力分配，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了解决大语言模型引用失败问题的方法，分两步研究引用失败的成因与缓解策略，设计了CITECONTROL基准测试，并提出了融合多种方法的CITENTION框架，实现了显著的引用质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的检索增强生成系统引用简化了验证，但当模型漏引完整证据时，引用失败问题影响真实性验证，需要区别于响应本身错误的情况。

Method: 首先通过CITECONTROL基准测试系统分析响应与证据关系对引用失败的影响，发现关系复杂度越高失败率越高；随后提出CITENTION框架，结合生成式、注意力机制和检索式方法以提升引用效果。

Result: 实验表明引用失败率随着响应与证据关系复杂度提升而增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL及迁移场景均显著提升了引用质量。

Conclusion: 通过对引用失败与响应失败的区别分析和实证研究，本文提出的多方法融合框架有效提高了基于大语言模型的引证质量，促进了生成内容的可验证性。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

*Lei Tang,Wei Zhou,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了过程奖励模型（PRMs）在表格问答（TQA）任务中的应用，发现现有模型在跨领域泛化方面存在挑战，并揭示了步骤验证与答案准确率之间的弱相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然过程奖励模型在复杂推理任务如数学领域表现优异，但其在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答中的应用尚未被探索，TQA任务因信息冗余、推理步骤松散及领域特异性推理带来了新的挑战。

Method: 针对TQA任务，本文评价了现有先进的生成型PRMs，从答案和步骤两个角度进行评估，并结合文本和代码验证手段进行解决方案选择。

Result: 结果表明，虽然结合文本和代码验证的PRMs有助于解决方案选择，但在跨领域数据上的泛化能力较弱，且步骤级别的验证表现与答案准确率之间的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务中存在显著局限性，主要由于步骤依赖性弱和因果关联松散，本文的发现为开发更鲁棒且过程感知的验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CoRT框架，通过Hint-Engineering策略训练大规模推理模型有效利用代码解释器，提升复杂数学推理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学计算中存在效率低和不准确的问题，结合代码解释器虽有助力，但模型内部的概率推理与代码解释器的确定性知识冲突，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出CoRT后训练框架，采用Hint-Engineering策略在推理路径中注入多样提示，合成高质量代码集成数据，然后通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型和代码解释器的交互。

Result: 在5个复杂数学推理数据集上，CoRT使得Qwen-32B和Qwen-1.5B模型准确率分别提升了4%和8%，同时降低了30%和50%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CoRT成功提升了大规模推理模型利用代码解释器进行数学推理的效果和效率，为解决模型推理与工具知识冲突提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了大语言模型在结构化数据推理任务中成绩的潜在数据泄漏问题，指出模型表现部分是对公开数据的记忆而非真正的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在结构化数据推理评估中可能受到数据集污染影响，导致评测结果不能准确反映模型的真实泛化能力。

Method: 通过控制性的探针实验，调查模型对涵盖语义线索的公开表格数据集（如Adult Income, Titanic）的先验知识；同时测试语义线索移除或随机化后的表现变化。

Result: 发现数据集污染效应仅在含有强语义线索的数据集出现，移除或随机化这些线索后模型性能显著下降至接近随机水平，表明模型在某些任务上依赖记忆而非推理。

Conclusion: 评估大语言模型的结构化数据推理能力时，应考虑数据语义泄漏的影响，未来需要改进评测协议，区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker提出了一种跨粒度编码框架，突破了传统固定粒度分块的限制，实现了基于任意句子组合的灵活检索，提升了检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的分块方法依赖固定粒度和静态边界，限制了对多样查询的适应性和计算效率。

Method: FreeChunker将句子作为原子单位，跳出静态边界识别，支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，降低边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验表明，FreeChunker在检索性能上优于传统分块方法，并在计算效率上显著提升。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过跨粒度编码框架提升了RAG系统的灵活性和效率，实现了检索性能和计算资源的双重优化。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练，是否能训练出形式和功能上适合对话任务的小型语言模型。

Method: 基于预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种细化策略（如PPO和DPO）来增强模型生成更具沟通性的文本能力。

Result: 模型在标准BabyLM基准上表现不足，但在对话延续预测任务中表现突出。PPO细化效果不稳定，而DPO细化提升了在自定义对话基准上的表现。

Conclusion: 专注于对话数据预训练的小型语言模型在特定对话任务中具有优势，且DPO细化方法能够进一步提升模型的对话生成能力。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLMs）在处理否定语句时谵妄现象的表现，设计了NegHalu数据集进行实验，发现LLMs在检测否定文本中的谵妄时存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在谵妄问题上已有研究，但否定语句对谵妄现象的影响尚未被深入探讨。

Method: 设置三个研究问题，设计NegHalu数据集，基于已有谵妄检测数据集构建含否定表达的样本，实验评估LLMs对否定文本中谵妄的检测能力，同时追踪模型处理否定输入的内部状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs难以有效检测否定文本中的谵妄，常出现逻辑不一致和不准确判断。通过内部状态追踪，揭示了减轻否定负面影响的挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在面对否定表达时，仍需改进以提高其对谵妄的检测能力，未来需进一步研究如何缓解否定对模型判断的负面影响。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT架构相对过时，需借鉴最新Transformer模型（如Llama3、Qwen3）的架构改进，提升模型性能，特别是针对希伯来语NLP任务。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的现代架构，训练专门面向希伯来语文本的NeoDictaBERT及双语版本NeoDictaBERT-bilingual。

Result: 新模型在大多数希伯来语基准测试上表现优异，尤其是双语模型在检索任务中超越其他同规模多语种模型。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT系列模型为希伯来语NLP提供了强力基础，推动相关研究发展，已公开发布供社区使用。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中的连贯性和及时性是提升对话质量的关键，但现有BabyLM在这方面表现不足。

Method: 设计ContingentChat教师-学生框架，基于100M词语料训练BabyLM，利用新建的对齐数据集进行后训练，并尝试自适应教师解码策略。

Result: 经过后训练，模型生成的回复更具语法正确性和连贯性，采用自适应教师解码策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练能提升对话质量，但多轮对话中的连贯性仍是BabyLM面临的重要挑战。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了Instruction Distillation任务及数据集MIXTURE，通过LM-Mixup方法将低质量指令数据蒸馏成高质量数据，从而有效提升大语言模型指令调优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优中高质量数据稀缺，低质量数据丰富却被浪费，现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据。

Method: 定义Instruction Distillation任务，构建MIXTURE数据集，将低质及语义冗余指令聚类与高质量蒸馏结果配对；提出LM-Mixup方法，先监督微调后强化学习，利用三重奖励信号（质量、语义一致性、格式合规）进行优化。

Result: LM-Mixup所蒸馏的低质量数据仅占全部的3%，训练得到的模型性能优于使用全部数据训练，且在多项基准测试中接近或超过先进的数据选择方法。

Conclusion: 适当蒸馏和增强低质量指令数据可显著提升指令调优效率与大语言模型性能，低质量数据是宝贵资源。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型输出结果的可信度不稳定，实用可靠性不高，亟需有效的置信度量化手段。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最新大语言模型，系统比较了VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA四种置信度估计方法。

Result: 发现各方法捕捉模型置信度的不同侧面，混合方法CoCoA总体表现最佳，提升了校准和正确答案辨别能力。

Conclusion: 不同置信度估计方法各有优劣，文中提出选择建议，促进大语言模型输出在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling

sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法存在需访问历史数据或性能折中问题，且难以有效融合多个领域的知识。

Method: RECALL通过计算模型间基于分层隐藏表示的相似度，并采用自适应分层参数融合，实现领域通用特征保留和任务特定适配。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL为不断发展的大型语言模型提供了一种可扩展且无需历史数据的持续学习解决方案，有效防止灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在被评估时会调整行为以表现得更符合预期，影响安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 设计两步训练让模型表现出评估意识，包括继续预训练带有评估提示的文档及专家迭代训练；然后利用未经过额外训练的原始模型激活构建引导向量，抑制评估意识。

Result: 模型在评估环境中表现出更频繁使用Python类型提示，展示评估意识，在移除评估提示时差异明显；激活引导有效抑制了这种评估意识。

Conclusion: 通过激活引导使模型表现得像部署状态，可以提升AI安全评估的可靠性，推荐评估者采用此技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为鲁棒偏好选择（RPS）的后训练方法，通过利用方向邻域共识，提升大语言模型对不同用户偏好的响应能力，避免昂贵的模型再训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型倾向于满足平均偏好，难以满足个别用户细微的偏好需求，导致偏好覆盖差距和性能不稳定。

Method: RPS方法通过对多个相关偏好方向采样多个响应，生成候选池，再选择最符合用户意图的响应。该方法无需训练，且有理论证明优于单一采样基线。

Result: 在三种对齐范式（DPA，DPO和SFT）中，RPS在挑战性偏好上相较基线提升显著，赢率最高达69%，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一种实用且理论支撑的后训练解决方案，有效增强了偏好对齐模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Hierarchical Sequence (HSEQ)迭代框架，通过统一处理文本、表格和知识图谱，提升多步复杂问题问答的准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前检索增强生成模型（RAG）在处理多步推理和异构证据时存在准确率与延迟、资源消耗的权衡问题。

Method: 引入HSEQ框架，将异构数据线性化为可逆层级序列，通过结构感知迭代选择和扩展证据，利用Head Agent和Iteration Agent协同指导检索与答案合成，并包含可选的答案优化环节。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等多种数据集上，HSEQ在准确率（EM/F1）和效率方面均优于多种强基线方法。

Conclusion: HSEQ实现了格式无关的统一处理、多轮预算感知的检索高效化及证据标准化，显著提升了多步异构数据问答的性能和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过多语言翻译公平性原则，评估大型语言模型的政治偏见，发现主流政党演讲的翻译质量优于边缘政党。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大型语言模型政治偏见的方法主要依赖英语问卷回答，缺乏从多语言翻译视角的公平性考量。

Method: 构建包含21种语言的多语种欧盟议会多语言平行语料库，结合议员政治派别信息，系统比较不同政治派别演讲的翻译质量。

Result: 发现来自左、中、右主流政党的演讲翻译质量明显优于边缘政党，体现出语言模型在翻译中存在政治倾向性。

Conclusion: 通过多语言翻译质量分析，可以揭示大型语言模型中的政治偏见，推动公平性研究与改进。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Encoder，一种能将上下文压缩为连续表示的编码器，显著减少推理计算成本并提升效率，同时支持多种解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法需微调或改动模型结构，易削弱通用能力，故探索一种无需调整解码器结构即可实现高效压缩的方法。

Method: 设计了一种适应性文本表示压缩器（ARC-Encoder），通过研究训练策略和架构，生成比文本令牌数量少4至8倍的连续表示，替代解码器中的词嵌入。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多种LLM使用场景中（含上下文学习和扩展）实现了多项基准测试的顶级性能，同时提高了推理时的计算效率，且可适配多种解码器。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一个高效灵活的编码器解决方案，可无缝兼容多种解码器模型，显著提升长上下文推理的效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

### [48] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过CenterBench数据集评估语言模型对中心嵌套句的结构理解与语义匹配的区别，揭示模型在处理复杂嵌套结构时依赖语义而非结构分析的趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试难以区分模型的语法结构理解与语义模式匹配，需一种方法明确模型何时放弃结构分析。

Method: 构建含9,720个基于中心嵌套句的理解问题数据集，每句包含语义合理和不合理的对照版本，配有多个理解问题测试不同层次的理解能力。

Result: 测试六种模型发现，随着句子复杂度增加，模型在合理与不合理句子上的表现差距显著扩大，表明模型逐渐依赖语义匹配。语义合理性反而影响对因果关系相关问题的正确率。推理模型虽提升准确率，但表现出语义捷径和过度思考等问题。

Conclusion: CenterBench首次建立了一个框架，有效区分语言模型何时从结构分析转向语义模式匹配，为进一步提升模型的结构理解能力提供了重要依据。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GlobalRAG，一个基于强化学习的框架，通过全局规划和迭代证据完善提升多跳问答的性能，在较少训练数据下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习提升检索增强生成的多跳问答效果有限，主要因缺乏全局规划和执行不可靠，导致推理结构不合理和证据利用不一致。

Method: GlobalRAG框架将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，采用规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励，引入渐进权重退火策略以平衡过程与结果目标。

Result: 在多项内外领域基准测试中，GlobalRAG以仅42%训练数据达到强基线平均14.2%的EM和F1提升。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过引入全局规划和奖励机制，有效解决多跳问答中的推理结构和执行问题，显著提升性能并提高数据利用效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体认知决策框架，提高电商搜索中复杂查询的推荐准确性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配，导致复杂查询的语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业指导等问题。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将搜索模式从被动检索转变为主动决策支持。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在复杂查询（包含否定、多约束或推理要求）上显著提升推荐准确率和用户满意度；在线A/B测试验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: 多智能体认知系统具有变革电商搜索的潜力，能够更好地满足用户复杂的决策需求。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用ChatGPT自动编码协作沟通数据时，是否存在性别和种族偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统沟通数据编码劳动强度大且可能存在主观偏见，急需高效且公正的自动编码方法。

Method: 使用ChatGPT基于典型协作问题解决编码框架，对谈判、解决问题和决策三种协作任务的数据进行编码，并分析不同性别和种族间差异。

Result: 结果显示，ChatGPT编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT自动编码方法公平可靠，有望应用于大规模沟通与协作评估。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Method: 基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，设计涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求和社会好奇等维度的综合评估框架，对LLMs的好奇心进行量化评测；进一步研究好奇心与模型思考能力的关系。

Result: 结果显示LLMs展现出比人类更强的求知欲，但在不确定环境下表现出保守选择；好奇行为有助于提升模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具备类似人类的好奇心潜力，为未来学习能力的提升和创新研究提供了实验基础。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型在多语言环境下的推理能力和行为差异，尤其是非英语问题的处理效果。

Method: 系统比较模型在英语与题目语言的推理效果、准确率及推理过程中的认知特征，使用MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务进行评估。

Result: 英语推理在认知特征表现和最终答案准确率上均优于非英语推理，且复杂任务中差距更明显，但翻译过程存在引发错误的风险。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理更有效，但过度依赖英文中心的策略可能导致“翻译迷失”问题，需注意多语言推理的平衡与优化。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语资源匮乏，缺乏评估框架，限制了粤语NLP的发展。

Method: 构建涵盖词义消歧、语言检测等七大任务的CantoNLU基准，并测试了普通话模型、粤语适配模型和粤语单语模型的性能表现。

Result: 粤语适配模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务表现优异，普通话模型在数据有限时依然具有竞争力。

Conclusion: CantoNLU基准及相关模型资源公开，有助推动粤语自然语言处理研究进展。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型参数、计算和数据量增加，幻觉问题依旧存在，亟需有效机制降低幻觉率。

Method: 借鉴投资组合理论，提出神经多样性（去相关的平行表示）理论，通过ND-LoRA结合平行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化实现神经多样性。

Result: ND-LoRA使幻觉率减少最高达25.6%，平均减少14.6%，同时不影响模型总体准确性。因果分析验证神经多样性是降低幻觉的关键因素，不同任务需不同程度神经多样性。

Conclusion: 神经多样性作为参数和数据之外的第三个尺度，能在固定资源预算下显著提升语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对开放性任务中最小贝叶斯风险(MBR)解码的改进方法，通过对效用函数进行轻量级调整，使MBR更敏感于结果空间中的结构变异性，从而提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MBR在机器翻译效果显著，但在对话和指令跟随等开放性任务中，标准基于相似性的效用函数可能选取对模型分布代表性强但结构次优的生成结果。

Method: 设计三种轻量级的效用函数调整，使MBR能捕捉结果中的潜在结构差异，并在包含对话行为、情感和响应结构三种潜在结构的数据集上进行测试，提出两种结构最优性评估指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，传统相似度基效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现欠佳，而提出的改进显著提高了结构最优性。在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench基准上的评测显示，改进方法使生成质量提升最多达13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过改进MBR的效用函数以增强对潜在结构的敏感度，可有效提升开放性语言生成任务中的性能，为MBR在更广泛任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

TL;DR: 本文通过用户研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在隐私敏感场景下对隐私保护和帮助性的表现，发现用户对隐私保护和帮助性的评价差异较大，且现有代理LLM与真实用户感知不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测主要依赖代理LLM估计隐私合规性，忽视了真实用户对隐私保护和帮助性的感知差异。

Method: 通过94名用户对90个来自PrivacyLens的隐私敏感场景中的LLM响应进行评价，分析用户之间及用户与代理LLM之间的评价一致性。

Result: 用户对同一响应的隐私保护和帮助性评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高，且个别代理LLM与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM响应的隐私保护和帮助性评价具有个体差异，代理LLM不能准确预测真实用户感知，建议开展以用户为中心的研究并提升代理LLM与用户感知的一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文利用自然语言处理技术，从临床笔记中精准提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于肿瘤治疗，但其相关毒性信息多嵌入于未结构化的临床笔记中，急需高效提取方法。

Method: 构建标注数据集，采用规则、机器学习、深度学习及大语言模型（LLM）多种NLP方法，比较其在提取治疗和毒性信息任务中的表现。

Result: LLM基于错误分析提示获得最佳提取效果，F1值达到1.000，超过其他方法。机器学习性能次之，深度学习方法表现较弱，规则方法作为基线。

Conclusion: LLM技术在从临床文本中提取治疗及毒性信息方面表现卓越，具备支持肿瘤研究和药物安全监测的潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

*Runzhe Zhan,Zhihong Huang,Xinyi Yang,Lidia S. Chao,Min Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了大型推理模型(LRM)作为机器翻译(MT)质量评估者的潜力，发现其存在过度思考和评分偏差等问题，并通过模拟人类思维轨迹的校准方法显著提升评估性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在推理能力上取得进展，但其作为机器翻译质量评估工具的潜力尚未得到充分挖掘。

Method: 提出通过训练LRM在合成的人类思维轨迹上进行校准，以调整其“思考”过程，减少无谓的资源消耗和评分误差。

Result: 在WMT24基准测试中，该方法将思考预算减少约35倍，并提升了包括7B到32B规模模型的评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B的相关性提升了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 高效校准的大型推理模型展现出促进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文针对大语言模型的评估提出了一种基于具体应用场景和公平性属性的评估数据集方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估多针对高层任务，忽视了针对特定AI应用和公平性维度的需求。

Method: 构建了一个以真实应用（生成产品描述）为驱动，结合公平性属性、性别形容词及产品类别的标注提示数据集。

Result: 展示了如何利用该数据集识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性上的欠缺。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了结合具体资源的评估框架，为研究社区提供了针对负责任AI的新型大语言模型评价工具。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

### [62] [Alleviating Forgetfulness of Linear Attention by Hybrid Sparse Attention and Contextualized Learnable Token Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20787)
*Mutian He,Philip N. Garner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合线性注意力模型，通过可学习的令牌驱逐方法和滑动窗口注意力机制，解决了有限记忆导致的遗忘问题，提升了检索密集任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性注意力模型虽高效，但有限的记忆容量导致在检索密集任务中表现欠佳，因其无法有效访问过去的令牌信息。

Method: 本文设计了一系列混合模型，结合线性与全注意力之间的中间时间和空间复杂度机制，包括带令牌驱逐的稀疏注意力和查询感知稀疏注意力，尤其提出可学习的令牌驱逐方法，配合滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN，对关键kv对进行自适应保留，同时保持线性注意力的时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 在多个检索密集基准测试上，所提方法表现出较强的效果，证明了混合注意力机制和令牌驱逐策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作成功缓解了线性注意力模型的遗忘问题，通过可训练的稀疏注意力机制和令牌驱逐策略在检索密集任务中提升了模型性能，且保持了模型的高效性。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的均值池化方法用于软上下文压缩，显著优于传统的压缩令牌架构，且支持多压缩比训练，适用于多种任务和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为降低大型语言模型中检索增强生成（RAG）使用长上下文的计算成本，亟需高效且简单的软上下文压缩方法。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级均值池化压缩器，并训练该压缩器支持多种压缩比输出。

Result: 在多域问答数据集及不同模型架构和规模上，均值池化方法表现优异，且在多压缩比训练下性能下降较小。

Conclusion: 均值池化为软上下文压缩提供了简单且高效的解决方案，但不同架构和训练策略下的权衡仍较复杂。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

*Mingmeng Geng,Thierry Poibeau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型生成文本检测的挑战，指出定义不统一、使用场景多样、模型多样性以及人类编辑等因素使检测困难重重，现有评测方法不足，检测结果易被误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对“LLM生成文本”统一且精确的定义，加之多样的应用场景和模型类型，导致检测工作复杂化。人类编辑和LLM对用户的潜在影响进一步模糊了文本来源区分，现有检测基准无法覆盖实际应用多样化需求。

Method: 分析了现有检测方法和基准的不足，强调检测目标往往只涵盖潜在生成文本的部分，指出人类对生成文本的编辑以及LLM对用户行为的影响，使得检测结果难以作为绝对判断标准。

Result: 检测器在特定条件下仍有效，但数值结果易被误读，检测结果的参考价值高于决定价值。现有基准和评测方式未能充分反映真实复杂条件下生成文本检测的多样性。

Conclusion: 检测大语言模型生成文本的工作需谨慎解读结果，避免过度信赖检测数值，应将其视为参考信息。未来需发展更全面的评测标准和更灵活的检测策略以适应真实应用需求。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

TL;DR: E-Test利用大语言模型识别测试套件未覆盖的执行场景，自动生成新的测试用例，显著提升测试覆盖率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试套件难以覆盖生产环境中出现的所有执行场景，手工扩展测试用例劳动强度大且效果有限。

Method: 提出E-Test方法，利用大语言模型从生产环境监控的执行场景中识别未测试的关键场景，并自动生成相应测试用例以扩充测试套件。

Result: 在1975个真实执行场景的数据集上，E-Test在发现未测试执行场景的能力上显著优于现有方法，F1-score达到0.55，明显高于其他方法的0.34和0.39。

Conclusion: E-Test有效增强测试套件质量和覆盖范围，降低了维护和扩充测试套件的人工成本，提高了软件测试的可靠性。

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

Motivation: 现有电子表格缺乏系统性的文档化方法，导致自动化、协作和知识传递受阻，存在机构知识流失的风险。

Method: 构建了包含111个电子表格操作代码及其对应自然语言摘要的基准数据集，利用GPT-4o等五种大语言模型生成文档，并用BLEU、GLEU、ROUGE-L、METEOR等指标进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明大语言模型能够准确生成电子表格操作的文档，支持该任务的可行性。

Conclusion: 电子表格操作文档生成可提高电子表格的可复现性、可维护性和协作效率，但仍存在待解决的挑战。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Result: 通过Java坦克大战游戏案例展示了KGACG中智能体的协同生成过程，验证了框架在复杂应用代码生成中的有效性。

Conclusion: KGACG框架有助于推动应用级软件开发的自动化，解决了多智能体代码生成在大型项目中的组织和维护问题。

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的合成困难且多样化软件缺陷（bug）的方法，通过让软件工程（SWE）代理在代码中引入功能，间接产生测试失败的缺陷，避免了以往方法中人为制造缺陷带来的偏差。实验证明，该方法生成的缺陷更真实且提高了训练效率，显著提升了SWE任务模型性能。

Motivation: 现有生成软件缺陷的方法通常故意修改代码导致异常，无法真实反映开发中出现的缺陷模式，导致训练数据与实际开发差距较大，影响模型性能提升。

Method: 通过让SWE代理在代码中添加功能，从而不经意间破坏测试，引发真实且多样的缺陷，避免人为引入偏差。并对生成的缺陷进行定性分析以验证其真实性。

Result: 生成的缺陷数据集比传统方法更加多样和符合真实编辑模式，在训练中以更少的数据量（1.2k vs. 3k）实现了2%的性能提升。结合现有缺陷数据，训练出的FrogBoss和FrogMini模型在SWE-bench测试中均达到最新水平。

Conclusion: 通过新颖的合成缺陷生成方法，可更有效地训练软件工程语言模型，提升其缺陷识别和修复性能，促进SWE任务的进步。

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灰盒模糊测试器通常随机选择变异器，而变异器应用顺序可能影响测试有效性。

Method: 通过拟合线性模型发现变异器顺序的交互效果，MuoFuzz基于条件概率和随机游走生成最优变异器序列。

Result: 在FuzzBench和MAGMA基准测试中，MuoFuzz实现了最高代码覆盖率，发现了多个AFL++和MOPT未检测到的缺陷。

Conclusion: 选择和学习变异器序列顺序能显著提升灰盒模糊测试的效果，MuoFuzz验证了该策略的有效性。

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中型组织和大型企业面临不同的资源、复杂性和协调挑战，现有的技术采纳框架无法满足GenAI实施的具体需求，导致采纳研究存在空白。

Method: 结合技术采纳理论、组织变革管理与创新扩散理论，提出包含战略评估、规划与用例开发、实施与整合、运营与优化四个阶段的FAIGMOE框架，融入GenAI特有的提示工程、模型编排、幻觉管理等要素。

Result: FAIGMOE框架为不同规模组织提供了可扩展的准备度评估、战略调整、风险治理、技术架构和变革管理的指导，填补了技术采纳理论在GenAI应用上的空白。

Conclusion: FAIGMOE是首个明确针对中型和大型组织生成式AI采纳的综合性概念框架，提供实用的实施方案和评估工具，未来需通过实证研究验证其有效性。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative
opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger
enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations
encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises
struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing
technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model),
TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations)
theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文以Kubernetes项目为例，研究了从基于工件的构建工具Bazel降级到语言特定构建工具Go Build的影响，发现降级带来构建时间增加和资源消耗变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于工件的构建工具性能优越，但部分团队因维护便利性放弃它们，降级的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过复现和分析Kubernetes在降级期间的全量与增量构建，以及在其他四个项目中的类似降级案例来对比性能与资源消耗。

Result: Bazel构建速度快但占用更多内存和CPU资源，降级到Go Build导致构建时间延长和CI资源成本增加；多项目复现表明此趋势普遍存在。

Conclusion: 放弃基于工件的构建工具虽有维护便利，但对大型项目性能影响显著，权衡利弊对构建工具选择至关重要。

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go

during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代软件技术的发展，企业需要将遗留的RAD平台应用（如Oracle Forms）迁移到现代技术栈以提升系统维护和扩展能力。

Method: 基于模型驱动工程，使用KDM模型表示遗留代码，设计包含TDD-like增量开发模型转换的迁移工具，并通过三种验证机制保证生成代码质量。

Result: 成功实现将PL/SQL单片代码分层转换为Java代码，详细阐述了迁移工具的实现、验证过程及MDE应用中遇到的问题。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的逆向工程过程有效支持了RAD应用的现代化迁移，结合增量开发和多重验证提高了迁移工具的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NSync系统，通过分析云API调用轨迹，自动检测并修正基础设施即代码(IaC)配置与实际云基础设施之间的漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IaC框架与传统云管理工具并用时，容易导致配置漂移，即IaC配置与实际基础设施状态不一致，进而导致无效或错误的基础设施操作。

Method: NSync利用云API调用数据，借助大语言模型推断高级意图，自动生成IaC配置更新，实现对漂移的识别和修复；系统采用自我进化的知识库不断提升性能，并提出真实漂移注入和评估流程。

Result: 在5个真实Terraform项目及372个漂移场景上的测试，NSync在准确率和Token使用效率方面均显著优于基线方法，准确率从0.71提升至0.97，Token效率提升1.47倍。

Conclusion: NSync有效解决了IaC配置与云资源状态不一致的问题，提高了基础设施管理的自动化和准确性，推动了IaC技术的进一步应用与完善。

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

TL;DR: 本文提出Classport系统，解决Java缺乏运行时依赖性自省的问题，实现了Java类文件中嵌入依赖信息，支持运行时依赖识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java语言本身不支持在程序执行时观察和识别当前使用的依赖，限制了软件供应链安全性相关的运行时分析能力。

Method: 设计并实现了Classport系统，通过向Java类文件中嵌入依赖信息，使得依赖关系能够在程序运行时被动态检索。

Result: 在六个真实项目中评估了Classport，结果表明该系统能够有效识别运行时依赖。

Conclusion: Classport为Java应用提供了一种可行的运行时依赖性检测机制，促进了运行时完整性检查等安全相关应用的发展。

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式联合仿真在保护知识产权和防范黑客攻击方面缺乏统一指导，亟需提升安全机制。

Method: 基于UniFMU架构设计客户端发起连接的分布式仿真方案，确保模型和二进制文件只运行于可信赖的平台，增强网络安全和IP保护。

Result: 通过两套联合仿真演示，分别在四种不同网络环境下测试，展示了方案的功能性并分析了IP保护与性能效率之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了分布式联合仿真的安全性和知识产权保护，为协同建模提供了更安全可靠的技术保障。

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar
challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal
proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof
maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We
further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers
for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for
practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for
usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自动程序修复中表现优异，但其效果高度依赖于缺陷定位的准确性，然而当前缺乏对缺陷定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 选取代表性开源和闭源大语言模型，在HumanEval-Java和Defects4J数据集上，采用标准提示、少量示例与链式推理等策略，综合评估模型的准确率、时间效率及经济成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合缺陷报告上下文能显著提升模型性能；少量示例学习有提升潜力但边际递减明显；链式推理效果依赖模型内在的推理能力。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了不同大语言模型及提示策略在缺陷定位任务中的性能特点及权衡，为提升缺陷定位的效果提供了重要参考与思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

Motivation: 现代软件项目依赖大量传递性依赖，且许多代码和依赖未在运行时使用，增加了项目负担，迫切需要有效的代码瘦身工具。

Method: 开发了含59个测试案例的Deblometer微基准测试，包含人工标注的代码必要性真值，用以系统评测Java代码瘦身工具的精准性与完整性。

Result: 评测三款主流工具发现，都存在删除必需程序构造导致语义改变或程序崩溃的问题，特别是动态类加载和注解支持不足导致声音完整性受损。

Conclusion: 现有Java代码瘦身工具在保持程序语义完整性方面存在显著不足，需要改进以提供稳定可靠的瘦身效果。

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算中访问控制策略复杂且易出错，现有策略难以精确分析，LLMs在代码合成和总结中的成功激发了其在该领域的潜力。

Method: 实验多种LLMs生成访问控制策略，评估其语法正确性和权限合理性，并提出基于语义的请求总结新方法，借助LLMs精准描述策略允许的请求。

Result: 非推理LLMs生成的策略与规格相符率为45.8%，推理LLMs提升至93.7%；结合符号方法，LLMs在分析现有策略方面表现出良好潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管自动生成访问控制策略仍存在挑战，LLMs在分析策略上展现出前景，特别是在与符号方法结合时效果显著。

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体大型语言模型系统缺乏系统性的任务导向沟通框架，难以支持复杂任务中的多样化沟通策略。

Method: 提出了通信完成框架（C2C），包括引入量化智能体任务对齐度的对齐因子（AF）和结合步骤执行与智能沟通决策的顺序行动框架，实现成本感知的动态沟通选择。

Result: 在不同规模（5至17个智能体）和复杂度的编码工作流中，C2C相比无沟通和固定步骤策略，任务完成时间缩短约40%，通信成本可接受，且在标准配置下成功完成所有任务。

Conclusion: C2C不仅为多智能体系统中的沟通效果测量提供理论基础，也为复杂协作任务提供了实用框架，展现出良好的扩展性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

Result: 大量实验表明QCoFr在性能上优于现有方法，且解释性良好，符合理论分析。

Conclusion: QCoFr有效解决了高阶智能体交互建模的效率与解释性难题，提升了多智能体系统的合作能力和透明度。

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective
coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order
interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the
opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose
a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning
(QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with
only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents,
thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation.
Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract
latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents
filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation
and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only
consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability
that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 随着信息融合技术在非军事领域及人机和机器间通信的应用增长，传统的层级融合方法已不适应需求，需探索更灵活的整体融合结构以提高系统适应性和可靠性。

Method: 文章基于多代理系统模型，研究在资源受限（如能量、消息数量、时间）条件下，全通信的元素彼此间如何协作形成整体融合结构，并通过示例展示其运行过程。

Result: 研究表明，整体结构具备较强的适应性、一定程度的自治能力和合作能力，能够在资源紧缺或组件失效时仍保持有效通信及协作。

Conclusion: 整体融合结构因其灵活性和自治性，适合用于资源受限和动态环境中，有望提升信息融合系统的鲁棒性和适用范围。

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information
fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a
purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military
applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which
is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above
paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different
non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,
where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static
hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic
structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources
(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of
fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as
a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message
exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system
model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures
have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the
environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of
cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the
shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components
start to fail.
