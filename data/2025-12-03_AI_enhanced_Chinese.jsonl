To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "RxBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u7ee9\u4f18\u5f02\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u836f\u5242\u5e08\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u9898\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u9898\u5e93\uff0c\u7531\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u5242\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RxBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e2d14\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,150\u4e2a\u5355\u9009\u9898\u3001230\u4e2a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u548c879\u4e2a\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9898\u76ee\u5747\u7531\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u5242\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u3002\u5bf918\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5c42\u6b21\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6709\u6267\u7167\u836f\u5242\u5e08\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002RxBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u9762\u5411\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "RxBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension.

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u6b65\u957f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aCoherent Contextual Decoding\uff08CCD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCD\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.48\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c3.91%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CCD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This gives a more complete picture when deciding whether two programs are similar or not. Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score. Bin2Vec acts as a bridge between binary representations and machine learning techniques by generating feature representations that can be efficiently processed by machine-learning models. We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns.

Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models.

We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems by enabling trust-aware, scalable, and censorship-resistant interactions among autonomous agents. Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture. We formalize a trust-aware communication protocol that leverages cryptographic primitives and on-chain operations to provide security properties: verifiable interaction cycles, communication integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and conditional confidentiality, which we further substantiate through a comprehensive security analysis.

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bf9Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u516d\u79cd\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u65b9\u8a00\u65f6\uff0cMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u51cf\u5c1173.25%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.1\u500d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u5fae\u8c03\u53caPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.\n  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphectory\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u67904000\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ee5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphectory\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6307\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u67904000\u6761\u57fa\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u4e3b\u6d41\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6216\u66f4\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6df7\u4e71\u53cd\u590d\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5197\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "Graphectory\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u7ed3\u679c\u5bfc\u5411\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts.

Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior.

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.\n  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.\n  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish.

To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u7834\u574f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRESP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u51c6\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RLM\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u5e9e\u5927\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3RLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9RLM\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u526a\u679d\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u63d0\u51faRESP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ea\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u518d\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cRESP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GSM8K\u548cMathQA\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u572820-30%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u572840%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecd\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523081.3%\u548c59.6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RESP\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLM\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Indeed, SPL engineering can significantly impact a company's development process and often requires changes to established developer practices. The work presented in this paper stems from a collaboration with a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) that decided to migrate its existing code base into an SPL. In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities. Furthermore, our results suggest that an effective risk mitigation strategy involves keeping stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the process, preserving as many good practices as possible, and actively involving them in the migration to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ebf\u867d\u6311\u6218\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u73b0\u6709\u826f\u597d\u505a\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u987a\u5229\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u987a\u5229\u5b9e\u65bd\u5411\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ebf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u8bbf\u5173\u952e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5747\u8ba4\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u52a8\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0e\u4fdd\u969c\u826f\u597d\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u963b\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ebf\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4ee3\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e60\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6210\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u513f\u7ae5\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7c7b\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8bcd\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e60\u5f97\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u89c4\u5f8b\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Challenges such as low data maturity, lack of governance, misalignment between technical and business teams, and the absence of structured mechanisms to address ethical and sociotechnical risks have been widely identified in the literature. In this context, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the main risk management methodologies applied to data science projects, aiming to identify, classify, and synthesize their similarities, differences and existing gaps. An integrative literature review was performed using indexed databases and a structured protocol for selection and content analysis. The study examines widely adopted risk management standards ISO 31000, PMBOK Risk Management and NIST RMF, as well as frameworks specific to data science workflows, such as CRISP DM and the recently proposed DS EthiCo RMF, which incorporates ethical and sociotechnical dimensions into the project life cycle. The findings reveal that traditional approaches provide limited coverage of emerging risks, whereas contemporary models propose multidimensional structures capable of integrating ethical oversight, governance and continuous monitoring. As a contribution, this work offers theoretical support for the development of hybrid frameworks that balance technical efficiency, organizational alignment and responsible data practices, while highlighting research gaps that can guide future investigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u9879\u76ee\u9ad8\u5931\u8d25\u7387\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u5c11\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u5408\u6027\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecISO 31000\u3001PMBOK\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3001NIST RMF\uff0c\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u7279\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6CRISP DM\u548cDS EthiCo RMF\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u98ce\u9669\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u4f26\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d1\u5c55\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This approach promises to democratize software development, but its educational implications remain underexplored. This paper reports on a one-day educational hackathon investigating how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with vibe coding. We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices.

A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%.

As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training.

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER).", "AI": {"tldr": "CFaults\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eC\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u591a\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6574\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027(MaxSAT)\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9488\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6545\u969c\u7a0b\u5e8f/\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\uff08MBD\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684MaxSAT\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCFaults\u5728C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8eBugAssist\u3001SNIPER\u548cHSD\uff1b\u5728ISCAS85\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u7a0d\u5c11\u4f46\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u8f93\u51fa\u5b50\u96c6\u6700\u5c0f\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "CFaults\u5728C\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709FBFL\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u53ea\u4ea7\u751f\u5b50\u96c6\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5e03\u5c14\u7535\u8def\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u867d\u7a0d\u6162\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs).

It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics.

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems.

However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u4e2d\u89e3\u9898\u5668\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u660e\u786e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc737\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u3001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53ca\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u57289\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u540c\u65cf\u548c\u8de8\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u201c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u65cf\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u66f4\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u9898\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u65cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints", "comment": null, "summary": "We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u75c5\u6bd2\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u75c5\u6bd2\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5e76\u53d7\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u9020\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EVONS\u548cFakeNewsNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684RoBERTa\u548cMistral\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\u3001Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u75c5\u6bd2\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8f83\u96be\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b\u964d\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u75c5\u6bd2\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u9020\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u3002"}}

Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency).

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice.

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniFact\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9891\u7e41\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08HD\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08FV\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniFact\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0FV\u548cHD\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ca\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff081\uff09\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\uff082\uff09HD\u4e0eFV\u6355\u83b7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u9886\u57df\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings.

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684stable rank\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6570\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fastable rank\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO)\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "stable rank\u5728RewardBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523084.04%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u534711.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bSR-GRPO\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347Qwen2.5-1.5B\u6a21\u578b\u5728STEM\u4efb\u52a110%\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u740619%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165stable rank\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u8ba8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u5982\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u6307\u68075-10%\uff1b\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u67901000\u591a\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u8c13\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important.

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "SchED\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b03.8-4\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u6162\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u8303\u56f4logit\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5SchED\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2adLLMs\u53ca\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faSchED\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5168\u8303\u56f4logit\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e76\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(dLLMs)\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSchED\u5728\u591a\u79cddLLM\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.8-4.0\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e100%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002SchED\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u7684\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97SchED\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SchED\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347dLLM\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications.

This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoCoP\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4f26\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u573a\u666f\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u4f26\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0cMoCoP\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb(rET = -0.81\uff0cp < 0.001)\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCoP\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
