These challenges are particularly amplified in Simulink-Stateflow models due to the hierarchical structure these models have, which integrate continuous dynamics with discrete-event behaviors and are widely deployed in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). While prior work has explored machine learning and manually engineered mutation operators, these approaches remain constrained by limited training data and scalability issues. Motivated by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate their potential to generate high-quality, domain-specific mutants for Simulink-Stateflow models. We develop an automated pipeline that converts Simulink-Stateflow models to structured JSON representations and systematically evaluates different mutation and prompting strategies across eight state-of-the-art LLMs. Through a comprehensive empirical study involving 38,400 LLM-generated mutants across four Simulink-Stateflow models, we demonstrate that LLMs generate mutants up to 13x faster than a manually engineered mutation-based baseline while producing significantly fewer equivalent and duplicate mutants and consistently achieving superior mutant quality. Moreover, our analysis reveals that few-shot prompting combined with low-to-medium temperature values yields optimal results.

A PoC exploit is a program used to demonstrate how a vulnerability can be exploited. Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid.

By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62bd\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u62bd\u53d6\u63d0\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u53d6\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u603b\u7ed3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5426\u5bfc\u81f4\u62bd\u53d6\u5931\u8d25\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684MedDec\u51fa\u9662\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e03\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u62bd\u53d6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u836f\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u7b80\u6d01\uff0c\u800c\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u9884\u9632\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u66f4\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\uff0c\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u3001\u4ee3\u8bcd\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u8bed\u6c14\u3002\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a48%\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u653e\u5bbd\u5339\u914d\u6807\u51c6\u540e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5347\u81f371%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bb8\u591a\u9519\u8bef\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7c7b\u522b\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u62bd\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u8bed\u4e49\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u7801\uff08SCD\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u81f33%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6613\u53d7\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u540e\u95e8\u4e00\u65e6\u88ab\u5236\u9020\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u5bf9\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cSCD\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u5e73\u574789%\u964d\u81f3\u4e0d\u8db33%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1LLM\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u88ab\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Prior work has shown that Pull Requests (PRs) produced using coding agents (Agentic-PRs) are accepted less often than PRs that are not labeled as agentic (Human-PRs). The rejection reasons for a single agent (Claude Code) have been explored, but a comparison of how rejection reasons differ between Agentic-PRs generated by different agents has not yet been performed. This comparison is important since different coding agents are often used for different purposes, which can lead to agent-specific failure patterns. In this paper, we inspect 654 rejected PRs from the AIDev dataset covering five coding agents, as well as a human baseline. Our results show that seven rejection modes occur only in Agentic-PRs, including distrust of AI-generated code. We also observe agent-specific patterns (e.g., automated withdrawal of inactive PRs by Devin), reflecting differences in how agents are configured and used in practice. Notably, a large proportion of rejected PRs (67.9%) lack explicit reviewer feedback, making their rejection reasons difficult to determine. To mitigate this issue, we propose a set of heuristics that reduce the proportion of such cases, offering a practical preprocessing step for future studies of PR rejection in agentic coding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u88ab\u62d2\u7eddPull Requests\uff08\u4ee3\u7406PRs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210PRs\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406PRs\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u62d2\u7edd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4ea4\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u672a\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86AIDev\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d654\u4e2a\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u7684PRs\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e03\u79cd\u62d2\u7edd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ec5\u5728\u4ee3\u7406PRs\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7279\u5f81\uff1b67.9%\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u5ba1\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684PR\u62d2\u7edd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer.

We present ProxyWar, a novel framework that systematically assesses code generation quality by embedding LLM-generated agents within diverse, competitive game environments. Unlike existing approaches, ProxyWar evaluates not only functional correctness but also the operational characteristics of generated programs, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments to provide a holistic view of program behavior. Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement. These findings highlight the need for richer, competition-based evaluation of code generation. Looking forward, ProxyWar lays a foundation for research into LLM-driven algorithm discovery, adaptive problem solving, and the study of practical efficiency and robustness, including the potential for models to outperform hand-crafted agents.

But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression.

The four-stage process of analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition systematically extracts, abstracts, and transforms system artifacts. We apply our approach to a large industrial application built on legacy versions of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET MVC and show that core user interface components and page structures can be migrated semi-automatically to a modern web stack while preserving functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities. By consolidating architectural knowledge into explicit model representations, the resulting codebase exhibits higher maintainability and extensibility, thereby improving developer experience. Although automation is effective for standard patterns, migration of bespoke layout composites remains challenging and requires targeted manual adaptation. Our contributions are: (i) an end-to-end model-driven process, (ii) an enriched intermediate model that captures structure, dependencies, and semantic metadata, (iii) transformation rules that preserve functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities, and (iv) application and evaluation of the approach in an industrial setting. Overall, model-based abstractions reduce risk and effort while supporting scalable, traceable modernization of legacy applications. Our approach generalizes to comparable modernization contexts and promotes reuse of migration patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d2\u5165\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9057\u7559\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u5927\u3001\u624b\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6e21\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e2d\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u62bd\u8c61\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e.NET\u548cASP.NET MVC\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5927\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6838\u5fc3\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u548c\u9875\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5173\u952e\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u62bd\u8c61\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc1\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e03\u5c40\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do.

Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08LRF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "LRF\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9LLM\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u53cd\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fddLLM\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "LRF\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most effective for this unique and highly general transfer task? We give evidence that the correspondence between speech and language models and the brain derives from shared meaning abstraction and not their next-word prediction properties. In particular, models construct higher-order linguistic features in their middle layers, cued by a peak in the layerwise intrinsic dimension, a measure of feature complexity. We show that a layer's intrinsic dimension strongly predicts how well it explains fMRI and ECoG signals; that the relation between intrinsic dimension and brain predictivity arises over model pre-training; and finetuning models to better predict the brain causally increases both representations' intrinsic dimension and their semantic content. Results suggest that semantic richness, high intrinsic dimension, and brain predictivity mirror each other, and that the key driver of model-brain similarity is rich meaning abstraction of the inputs, where language modeling is a task sufficiently complex (but perhaps not the only) to require it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f55\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6bd4\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08fMRI\u548cECoG\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5cf0\u5bf9\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u9ad8\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u662f\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b-\u8111\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic approach for AKM, AgenticAKM, where the complex problem of architecture recovery and documentation is decomposed into manageable sub-tasks. Specialized agents for architecture Extraction, Retrieval, Generation, and Validation collaborate in a structured workflow to generate AK. To validate we made an initial instantiation of our approach to generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from code repositories.

In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens.

SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet.

We introduce DELTA, a deliberative multi-agent framework that models counseling as a structured reasoning process over multimodal signals, separating evidence grounding, mental state abstraction, and response generation. DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses.

This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u8f7b\u52a8\u8bcd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u8f7b\u52a8\u8bcd\u6784\u9020(LVC)\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f62\u6001\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u533a\u5206LVC\uff0c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u4f46\u654f\u611f\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f7b\u52a8\u8bcd\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5b57\u9762\u548c\u4e60\u8bed\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8c13\u8bcd\u9020\u6210\u5224\u65ad\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u660e\u786e\u54ea\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eLVC\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528UD\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5143\u7684TF-IDF+\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684BERTurk\u3001\u4ec5\u7528\u5f62\u6001\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u7684BERTurk\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6001\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u5355\u72ec\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065LVC\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u8bcd\u5143\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5224\u5b9a\u4f46\u5bf9\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8f7b\u52a8\u8bcd\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u52a8\u8bcd\u7ed3\u6784\u8fa8\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff0c\"\u4ec5\u8bcd\u5143\"\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e49\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u987b\u9488\u5bf9\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state.\n  In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks.

In contrast, safety risks emerging during training remain largely unexplored. Beyond explicit reward hacking that directly manipulates explicit reward functions in reinforcement learning, we study implicit training-time safety risks: harmful behaviors driven by a model's internal incentives and contextual background information. For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings.

The ensuing response of software engineering research yielded a massive body of tools and approaches. In this paper, we join the hassle by introducing agentic AI solutions for two tasks. First, we developed a solution for automatic test scenario generation from a detailed requirements description. This approach relies on specialized worker agents forming a star topology with the supervisor agent in the middle. We demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world example. Second, we developed an agentic AI solution for the document retrieval task in the context of software engineering documents. Our solution enables performing various use cases on a body of documents related to the development of a single software, including search, question answering, tracking changes, and large document summarization.

Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of \"over-refusal\", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term \"Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its \"usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u6709\u6bd2\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u79ef\u6781\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u4e24\u5927\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u201d\u88ab\u52a8\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u201c\u6709\u6bd2\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u7528\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u6bd2\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u4e3b\u8981\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6709\u6bd2\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u91c7\u53d6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u5176\u201c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e24\u5927\u4e3b\u8981\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5e76\u8861\u91cf\u4e86\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u201c\u6709\u6bd2\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u201d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Doing so helps mitigate external threats to the validity of the competition's results.\n  In this paper, we present the application of the ARG-V tool for automatically generating Java verification benchmarks in the SV-COMP format.

Under review", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic fluency but struggle to reliably complete long-horizon tasks under explicit procedural constraints. In legal cross-examination, purely proba-bilistic generation often maintains behavioral coherence while failing to ensure procedural advancement. We characterize this failure as procedural stagnation and propose Soft-FSM, a neuro-symbolic architecture that enforces monotonic progress over accumulated Key Information Units (KIUs) via an external deterministic state controller. Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy. These results suggest that, in such domains, reliable task completion cannot be guaranteed by emergent LLM behavior alone, and can be reliably enforced through explicit and verifiable external state control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSoft-FSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u514b\u670d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d28\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9075\u5b88\u4e25\u683c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4ea4\u53c9\u8d28\u8be2\u4e2d\u7eaf\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoft-FSM\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u53e5\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u771f\u5b9e\u5211\u4e8b\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e40%\uff0cSoft-FSM\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e97%\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u9760\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior.

One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.\n  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context.

This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity.

We notice that existing latent reasoning methods generally require model structure augmentation and exhaustive training, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency.

Execution-based re-ranking offers a promising test-time scaling strategy, yet existing methods are constrained by either difficult test case generation or inefficient random input sampling. To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs.

This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets.

However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy.

While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions.

A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u89c4\u8303\u7a0b\u5ea6\u662f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5c0f\u53d8\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u7528\u672a\u660e\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3001logit\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173token\u7684logit\u503c\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u8981\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u672a\u89c4\u8303\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9700\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u5730\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u3002"}}

Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., \"A is better than B\" vs. \"B is worse than A\") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of \"framing disparity\" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u54cd\u5e94\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u5373\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4f46\u8868\u8ff0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u968f\u6846\u67b6\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u4f46\u96be\u51cf\u5c0f\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GutBrainIE\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e1600\u591a\u7bc7PubMed\u6458\u8981\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u94fe\u63a5\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u57fa\u51c6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u80a0-\u8111\u8f74\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGutBrainIE\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u672f\u8bed\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf91600\u591a\u7bc7PubMed\u6458\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "GutBrainIE\u57fa\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80a0-\u8111\u8f74\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "GutBrainIE\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66IE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Evidence from Spatial n-Back in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Working memory is a central component of intelligent behavior, providing a dynamic workspace for maintaining and updating task-relevant information. Recent work has used n-back tasks to probe working-memory-like behavior in large language models, but it is unclear whether the same probe elicits comparable computations when information is carried in a visual rather than textual code in vision-language models. We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison. We further show that grid size alters recent-repeat structure in the stimulus stream, thereby changing interference and error patterns. These results motivate computation-sensitive interpretations of multimodal working memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4n-back\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u89c6-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u5426\u5f15\u53d1\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Qwen2.5\u548cQwen2.5-VL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4n-back\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u5b57\u6e32\u67d3\u7f51\u683c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u7f51\u683c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9010\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u8bc1\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6d'\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5339\u914d\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u636e\u6700\u8fd1\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u4e14\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u5c0f\u5f71\u54cd\u523a\u6fc0\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u5448\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u523a\u6fc0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative.

To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks.

As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost.

Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAUSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u5143\uff08AU\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5757\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u3001\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7c97\u7cd9\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5757\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u51fatoken\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAUSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\u5224\u522b\u6027AU\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8c03\u63a7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cAUSteer\u5728\u8c03\u63a7\u66f4\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5355\u5143\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684AU\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cAUSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\"\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\"\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5fae\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3(mDAPT)\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86mDAPT\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u6587\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eIT\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u68c0\u9a8cmDAPT\u3002", "result": "mDAPT\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "mDAPT\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

These aspects play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and ensuring responses are more relevant and consistent with user identity. However, recent studies indicate that open-source large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle to generate responses that are both contextually grounded and aligned with persona cues, despite exhibiting strong general conversational abilities like fluency and naturalness. We present PersoDPO, a scalable preference optimisation framework that uses supervision signals from automatic evaluations of responses generated by both closed-source and open-source LLMs to fine-tune dialogue models. The framework integrates evaluation metrics targeting coherence and personalization, along with a length-format compliance feature to promote instruction adherence. These signals are combined to automatically construct high-quality preference pairs without manual annotation, enabling a scalable and reproducible training pipeline.

To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining.

While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LycheeDecode\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u7684\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eHardKuma\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5212\u5206\u5c11\u6570\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u9009\u53d6\u5173\u952etoken\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7a00\u758f\u5934\u590d\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9btoken\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684top-k\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama3\u548cQwen3\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLycheeDecode\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.7\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u884c\u4e4b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters.

EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories.

There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability.

Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection.

T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining.

In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u9e1f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408CORAL\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u4fa7\u91cd\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5199\u4f5c\u5982\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5206\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6559\u5b66\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u9e1f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408CORAL\u98ce\u683c\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9ASAP++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5408\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\u5199\u4f5c\u6559\u5b66\u3002"}}

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "RexBERT\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u8bed\u4e49\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684BERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u5546\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u7535\u5546\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5927\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u7535\u5546\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u53c2\u6570\u591a\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u5546\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e863500\u4ebf\u8bcd\u7535\u5546\u8bed\u6599Ecom-niverse\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u57df\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u9000\u706b\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684RexBERT\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u53ea\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5927\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76841/2\u81f31/3\uff0cRexBERT\u5728\u7535\u5546\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7535\u5546\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u5546\u8bed\u4e49\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask.

However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLEAD\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e14\u76ee\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLEAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LEAD\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u6574\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%.

While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools.

Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation.

Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLinGO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u6697\u793a\u4f46\u8868\u8fbe\u6587\u660e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u5bb3\u4e0d\u6587\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "LinGO\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "LinGO\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u4f18\u5316\u548cGemini\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bed\u8a00\u6210\u5206\u878d\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERNIE 5.0\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ec4token\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eERNIE 5.0\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8861\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e07\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0cERNIE 5.0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning.

By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267.

Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.\n  Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance.

Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings.

Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities.

We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\\% to +38.5\\%, achieving up to 74\\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches.

This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u653e\u5f03\u56de\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u65e0\u7b54\u6848\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u653e\u5f03\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u653e\u5f03\u56de\u7b54\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u6559\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4(CoT)\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u653e\u5f03\u610f\u8bc6\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u653e\u5f03\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7RL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.46%-5.80%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u65e0\u7b54\u6848\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u8f83\u7eaf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u9ad820%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9690\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u653e\u5f03\u63a8\u7406\u5e2e\u52a9\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u653e\u5f03\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision.

However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniSIFT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9Omni-LLMs\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Omni-LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5757\u53bb\u9664\u89c6\u9891\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u97f3\u9891\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u8fc7\u6ee4\u97f3\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f20\u9012\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cOmniSIFT\u4ee5\u4ec525%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b8c\u6574\u4ee4\u724c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniSIFT\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86Omni-LLMs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization.

While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings.

Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u542b\u6709\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u5373\u4ee3\u8868\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u62d2\u7edd\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Jacobian\u8c31\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5bf9\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u4e2d\u6df1\u5c42\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u903b\u8f91\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d2\u7edd\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.\n  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RAL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5197\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RAL\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRAL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5GRPO\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\uff0cRAL\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}
