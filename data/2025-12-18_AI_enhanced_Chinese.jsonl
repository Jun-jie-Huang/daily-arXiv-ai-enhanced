An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5341\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\u672a\u88ab\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6500\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5341\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "Maven\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff0824.7\u500d\uff09\uff0cGo Modules\u3001npm\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0cCocoaPods\u6700\u4f4e\u300228% Maven\u9879\u76ee\u653e\u5927\u8d8510\u500d\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u653e\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u60c5\u51b5\u56e0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u70b9\u5236\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982Maven\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0cnpm\u548cRubyGems\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u9879\u76ee\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u826f\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u7ef4\u6301\u73b0\u72b6\u3002"}}

However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes.

Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes.

On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u7531\u8bc4\u4f30\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7b\u89c9\u662fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u7136\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u5426\u4e3aTransformer\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u524d\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb8\u53ef\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u6a21\u5757\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8bb8\u53ef\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points.

Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f15\u5165Wikidata\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u79fb\u6c11\u8fa9\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u8bdd\u9898\u548c\u89c2\u70b9\u5851\u9020\u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Wikidata\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bba\u70b9\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u89c2\u70b9\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5219\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention.

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RE2-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u81f4\u4f7f\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1101\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5176\u4e2d195\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\uff09\u7684RE2-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e5d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7968\u5236\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u4e3a\u201c\u7b80\u5355\u201d\u548c\u201c\u56f0\u96be\u201d\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528RE2-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea651.50%\u548c42.15%\u3002", "conclusion": "RE2-Bench\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8bc4\u6d4b\u9700\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRepGen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u518d\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60Bug\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680.19%\u7684\u518d\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u7684Bug\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u518d\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ec53%\u3002", "method": "RepGen\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5236\u5b9a\u5168\u9762\u518d\u73b0\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u590d\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728106\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eDL Bug\u4e0a\uff0cRepGen\u518d\u73b0\u7387\u8fbe80.19%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad819.81%\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad823.35%\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u51cf\u8f7b\u3002", "conclusion": "RepGen\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DL Bug\u518d\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u67e5\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u3002"}}

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528BPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u9690\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528BPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u9012\u5f52\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b50\u96c6\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5e38\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u5373\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f7fQwen2.5-1.5B\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1112%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53474%\uff1b\u5e7f\u4e49\u60c5\u51b5\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u635f\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7fGSM8K\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc72%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.\n  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797.

Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration.

The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5BODE-GEN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u63d0\u793a(prompt)\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "BODE-GEN\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9LLM\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u63d0\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u5148\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6HumanEval+\u4e0a\uff0cBODE-GEN\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "BODE-GEN\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002"}}

While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers.

However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\\% on AMC.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings.

Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MCP-SafetyBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6e10\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9eMCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684MCP-SafetyBench\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u5927\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3001\u4e3b\u673a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7aef\u768420\u79cdMCP\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u8de8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7MCP-SafetyBench\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\u5347\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0cMCP-SafetyBench\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668MCP\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u58f3\uff08AAS\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u58f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u53ea\u662f\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u8f74\u94e3\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u58f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u58f3\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u88ab\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u589e\u503c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers.

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRFKG-CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u521a\u6027\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u5e26\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u793a\u4f8b\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRFKG-CoT\u76f8\u6bd4KG-CoT\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u738714.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u4e92\u8865\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u8df3\u6570\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0cRFKG-CoT\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u8bb8\u53ef\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u6709\u8bb8\u53ef\u9650\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u8fdd\u89c4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.5%\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u4f7f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d10.19%\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bb8\u53ef\u5408\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

REST APIs expose web service functionality through endpoints, allowing easy client interaction over the Internet. To reduce the security risk resulting from exposed endpoints, thorough testing is desired. Due to the generally vast number of endpoints, automated testing techniques, like fuzzing, are of interest.\n  This paper introduces WuppieFuzz, an open-source REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, supporting white-box, grey-box and black-box fuzzing. Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.\n  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules.

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86FAME\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u9650\u82f1\u8bed\u4e14\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u6f14\u5458\u4f20\u8bb0\u300120000 QA\u5bf9\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u62c6\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "FAME\u8986\u76d6\u82f1\u3001\u6cd5\u3001\u5fb7\u3001\u610f\u3001\u897f\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u9057\u5fd8\u5c42\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FAME\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u865a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++.

We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations.

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u524d\u7f00\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPPO\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u7684token\u5747\u5300\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u524d\u7f00token\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u7f00\u9501\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff08BLE\uff09\uff0cPPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u4fdd\u7559\u524d\u7f00token\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752826.17%\u8bad\u7ec3token\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8618.02%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00token\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation.

Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08(MI)\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MI-LLMs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u54a8\u8be2\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7d20\u8d28\u4eba\u7c7b\u54a8\u8be2\u5e08\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u6545\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6587\u5fc3\u7406\u54a8\u8be2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528GPT-4\u8f6c\u5f55\u751f\u62102040\u6761MI\u98ce\u683c\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4e2d2000\u6761\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eMI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347BLEU-4\u548cROUGE\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u793aMI-LLMs\u5728\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc4\u5206\u53caMI\u9075\u5faa\u7387\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9eMI\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u63d0\u95ee\u6bd4\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MI\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u8d4b\u80fd\u901a\u7528LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u6838\u5fc3MI\u54a8\u8be2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5065\u5eb7\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u590d\u6742MI\u6280\u80fd\u53ca\u5b9e\u5730\u5e72\u9884\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns.

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation.

We study the learnability of a system of verbal inflection classes by the individual language user by performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes. As a cognitively plausible and interpretable computational model, we use Adaptive Resonance Theory, a neural network with a parameter that determines the degree of generalisation (vigilance). The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system.

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\uff08MWEs\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e2d\u6587MWEs\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\uff08MWEs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4e2d\u6587\u7b49\u8868\u610f\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5bf9\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u6587MWEs\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b57\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6c49\u5b57\u8fdb\u884c\u62c6\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9MWEs\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u8bcd\u4e49\u548c\u6539\u5584\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6c49\u5b57\u53ca\u8bcd\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u4e2d\u6587MWEs\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u8bcd\u8868\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u6587MWEs\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Bolmo\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b57\u8282\u5316\u800c\u6210\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5168\u5f00\u653e\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5236\u7ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9886\u5148\u5b50\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5408\u5b57\u8282\u5316\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0Bolmo\u4e0e\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5c06\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Bolmo\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b57\u7b26\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Bolmo\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses.

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684LLM-as-Judges\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eLLMs\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u754c\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u4e3a\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728LLM-as-Judges\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4ea4\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6307\u6807\u52a0\u6743\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u590d\u6838\u673a\u5236\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5728\u6b64\u524d\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting.

Oral Presentation", "summary": "State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u7f8e\u5f0f\u82f1\u8bed\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86SSM\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u660e\u786e\u5176\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4eceSSM\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08130M-1.4B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u57284-256\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\uff08\u6570\u5b57\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca\u548c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u7f8e\u5f0f\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u8f83\u5c11\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u4e86SSM\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u548c\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatentQA\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8f83\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u79f0\u4e3aActivation Oracles\uff08AOs\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "AOs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cLatentQA\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91caLLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
