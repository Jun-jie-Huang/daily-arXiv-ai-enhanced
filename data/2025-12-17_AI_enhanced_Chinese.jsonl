This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, and (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that AOI effectively mitigates information overload, achieving a 72.4% context compression ratio while preserving 92.8% of critical information and significantly enhances operational efficiency, attaining a 94.2% task success rate and reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 34.4% compared to the best baseline.

However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups. This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps.

We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones.

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aVGCO\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408LLMs\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u4f17\u591a\u4e14\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VGCO\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\u6536\u96c6\u5931\u6548\u6848\u4f8b\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u6863\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7279\u5f02\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u3002", "result": "VGCO\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u4fa7\u91cd\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0cVGCO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness.

The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5d4c\u5957\u91cd\u53e0\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5019\u9009\u8de8\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u8de8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5019\u9009\u7ec4\u5408\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728ACE 2005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c42\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations.

Prior work introduces the concept of \"effective depth\", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PerfCoder\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u5c55\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "PerfCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728PIE\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPerfCoder\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u610f\u8bc6\uff0cPerfCoder\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08AR\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u53ca\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3AR\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3adLM\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5757\u72b6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "Efficient-DLM\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AR\u548cdLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684AR-to-dLM\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance.

The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8fde\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u65e5\u8bed\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u6c49\u8bed\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08backchannel\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6300\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u53cc\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6CPU\u63a8\u7406\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u7528\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5982\u65e5\u8bed\u66f4\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ed\u671f\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u6c49\u8bed\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u4e8e\u9759\u9ed8\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u97f5\u5f8b\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e2e\u52a9\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6c49\u8bed\u8bed\u8c03\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u5177\u6587\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Java\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177Teralizer\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9Java\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177Teralizer\uff0c\u5c06JUnit\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u4e3ajqwik\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728EvoSuite\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTeralizer\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u65701-4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u6210\u719f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5199\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u5347\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u4f46\u5728632\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4ec51.7%\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91cd\u70b9\u653b\u5173\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}

We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn.

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility.

Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure.

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u5f15\u8d77\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\uff1a\u5ef6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u9650\u5236\u8282\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u65e5\u5e38\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u7d2f\u79ef\u8fd0\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u51cf\u6392\u63aa\u65bd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u8017\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89d2\u5ea6\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u7ea6\u3002"}}

The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\\_dialect:standard\\_bengali sentence pairs.

Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA.

Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $\u03c0$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task.

Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eEDU\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EDU\uff08Elementary Discourse Units\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6392\u540d\u6a21\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u6811\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u610f\u8bc6\u7684EDU\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro).

Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6253\u5305\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6253\u5305\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u6253\u5305\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6253\u5305\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u6863\u6253\u5305\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bfb\u627e\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u6863\u6253\u5305\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u6863\u6253\u5305\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models.

Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering \"easy\" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to \"hard\" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory.

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u6162\u4f46\u66f4\u6297\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u662f\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u628a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u590d\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec350\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f73\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f73\u76ee\u6807\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data.

To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs.

However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bb8\u591aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u9700\u5177\u5907\u6709\u9650\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u96c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u7535\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578bTiME\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u4ece\u591a\u8bed\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "TiME\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7387\u5173\u952e\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency.

Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MMGR\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u89c6\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u7269\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u30013D\u7a7a\u95f4\u30012D\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u7684MMGR\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u4e09\u5927\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7efc\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u9891\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u5148\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5e38\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u504f\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u7406\u6027\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002MMGR\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
