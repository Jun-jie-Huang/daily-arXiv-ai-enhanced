Under review", "summary": "Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u8f6e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u5b8c\u6210\u4e2d\u7b49\u96be\u5ea6\u7684Python\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u518d\u6309\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u538b\u7f29\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\uff1b\u7eaf\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\uff1b\u7eaf\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u4ee3\u7801\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional \"independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging\" to \"AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization.\" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u56fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u6027\u5730\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u7406\u89e3ChatGPT\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4f26\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u601d\u8003\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u751f\u666e\u904d\u9650\u5236ChatGPT\u8d21\u732e\u7ea630%\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5c11\u6570\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790AI\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u5bf9\u672a\u7f72\u540d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u4e0eAI\u5171\u5b66\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u5408\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents.

On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts.

These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts.

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters.

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLogPurge\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u65e5\u5fd7\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u5e38\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e72\u51c0\u4e14\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u83b7\u53d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u6d17\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "LogPurge\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u53bb\u9664\u805a\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5269\u4f59\u6c61\u79fd\u533a\u57df\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9010\u4e2a\u51c0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53bb\u9664\u4e8698.74%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8682.39%\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8635.7%\u300184.11%\u548c149.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "LogPurge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51c0\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio.

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management.

A Study on GM-Extract and Mitigations", "comment": "To be submitted for publication", "summary": "The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced.

This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KTester\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u6b63\u786e\u53c8\u6613\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "KTester\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u9879\u76ee\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u591a\u6837\u6d4b\u8bd5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9075\u5faa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\uff0cKTester\u5728\u6267\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u63d0\u53475.69%\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u53478.83%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u66f4\u5c11\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u66f4\u77ed\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e2d\uff0cKTester\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "KTester\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation.

Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models.

Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty.

However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval.

Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words.

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and employed the Gioia Methodology, an adapted grounded theory methodology from organizational behavior, to inductively derive taxonomies of motivations and challenges, and build the Exposure-Pursuit-Evaluation (EPE) Process Model. Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field.

Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA.

Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7b54\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684Transformer\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u53e5\u5b50\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7b54\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u5c06\u9898\u5e72\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u6b63\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u9898\u76ee\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u56de\u7b54\u586b\u7a7a\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u7ea670%\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9898\u76ee\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u7b54\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7b54\u9898\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u591a\u9009\u9898\u7b54\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction.

We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness.

Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness.

While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance.

Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities.

However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\uff08NCC\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bcd\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9009\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8bcd\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\uff08NCC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "NCC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe10%\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7b49\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u8bcd\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\uff0cNCC\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u7684EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff08TSSF\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLLMs\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684LLMs\u6613\u53d7\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u7c7b\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u7684EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6TSSF\uff1a1\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2\uff09\u9010\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0cTSSF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u62d2\u7edd\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cTSSF\u7a33\u5065\u9632\u5fa1\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u4e14\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6TSSF\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2dLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability.

Code and demo will be released at: https://github.com/trystine/Tell_Me_Mental_Wellbeing_System", "summary": "We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments.

It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states.

Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically.

However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement\" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance\" which is negative.

However, existing approaches \\textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \\textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{SMRC} (\\textit{\\underline{S}tudent \\underline{M}athematical \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \\texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \\textbf{solution accuracy} and \\textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images.

We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\\% of test cases compared to 68.7\\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u8bed\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f62\u6001\u7d20\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u8fbe\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eBPE\u548c\u8bcd\u7ea7\u5206\u8bcd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u5408\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u8bed\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eBiLSTM-CRF\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7d20\u5206\u5272\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bcd\u7ea7\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u7d20\u548cBPE\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u88ab\u4eba\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4f30\uff1b\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4ef7\u663e\u793a\u5f62\u6001\u7d20\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u7d20\u5206\u8bcd\u4e3a\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u8bed\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
