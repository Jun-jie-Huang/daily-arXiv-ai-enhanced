While\nexisting strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer\nfrom notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial\nbiases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of\nefficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although\nhigh-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable\nrequires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM\nagents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based \"coopetition\" mechanism. At each round,\nagents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or\ncompete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without\nrelying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves\nsignificant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a\n20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our\napproach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different\nsample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided \"coopetition\"\nframework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge\ndiversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven\nexploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From\nthis perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation\nand paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems.

However, it is widely agreed that\nunsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,\ninvolving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.\nIn this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost\nimpossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical\ninconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack\ngrounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence\nof tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome\nthese issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its\ncontext in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting\nindustrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors\nfor specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a\nrole in the real world.

In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label.

A key\nchallenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to\nnoisy annotation.\n  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation\nExtraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k\ncandidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic\nexemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars\nfrom training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the\nfinal relation(s).\n  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource\nlanguages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods\non English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse\nlow-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu.

In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation.

When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness.

Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem."}

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from\nexecuting test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is\ninefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual\nrepresentation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle\nlogical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel\napproach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training\npipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level\nexecution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution\nsemantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using\nexisting on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms\npost-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%\naverage relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to\nother coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning\nand test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong\napplicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe\nanalyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment\nbetween code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics."}
