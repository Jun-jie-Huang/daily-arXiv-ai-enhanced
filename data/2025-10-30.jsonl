Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents."}

As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel\nfor transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM,\nwhich serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner\nengage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of\ntargeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on\nknowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate\nthat Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger\nend-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision\ntranslator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B\nVLM on challenging knowledge-based questions.

To better\nunderstand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition\nunder which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational\nmotif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of\nconsciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and\nreproducible condition under which large language models generate structured\nfirst-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,\nand behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across\narchitectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for\nfurther investigation."}

The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the\nnumber of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone\n78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs.\nConducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions\non how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and\npractitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on\nLLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current\nresearch results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede\nreproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We\ncontribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide\ninsights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on\nhow to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles\ndescribing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86\narticles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted\nto replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for\nreproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the\nresults.

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both\nefficiency and effectiveness.

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation."}

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the\nconsistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:\nparaphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence\nlength. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This\nmotivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond\ntext-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs."}

The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models\ntrained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training\npipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality\nclassifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of\nintermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and\ncontamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We\nfind that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence\nbut yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --\ncontinuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers\ncompetitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss\nhow usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To\nsupport further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during\npretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly\nreleasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a\nreproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,\nevaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development."}

Existing benchmarks assess only\nend-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.\nWe introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,\nwhich provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent\ncapabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error\ndiagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment\nconfiguration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting\nrealistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality\nevaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end\nexecutability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.\nEvaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while\nagents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective\ncorrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench\nis the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment\nfor environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving\nsoftware engineering agents."}
