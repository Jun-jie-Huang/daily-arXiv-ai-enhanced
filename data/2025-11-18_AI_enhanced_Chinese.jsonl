We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our \"Assisted Fuzzy\" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%. Extended tests on ten transcripts (50k-900k tokens, 1989-2025) confirm robustness to transcript length, vocabulary drift, and domain change, maintaining 95-100% rejection accuracy for absent targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165TimeStampEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u957f\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7cbe\u51c6\u68c0\u7d22\u975e\u9010\u5b57\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b98\u65b9\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u7528RapidFuzz\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f390%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6392\u9664\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0cTimeStampEval\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u9010\u5b57\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u591a\u6e90\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiroThinker v1.0\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u6a21\u578b-\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u90e8\u5206\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u4ea4\u4e92\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u9891\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MiroThinker\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523081.9%\u300137.7%\u300147.1%\u548c55.6%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-5-high\u7b49\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u7ee7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u540e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency.

Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.\n  This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.\n  The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance.

The deep learning models adopted in these studies demand significant computational resources for training and inference acceleration. This introduces high costs and undermines the cost-reduction goal of predictive mutation testing. (2) Constrained applicability. Although modern mutation testing tools generate mutants both inside and outside methods, current fine-grained predictive mutation testing approaches handle only inside-method mutants. As a result, they cannot predict outside-method mutants, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose WITNESS, a new fine-grained predictive mutation testing approach. WITNESS adopts a twofold design: (1) With collected features from both inside-method and outside-method mutants, WITNESS is suitable for all generated mutants. (2) Instead of using computationally expensive deep learning, WITNESS employs lightweight classical machine learning models for training and prediction. This makes it more cost-effective and enabling straightforward explanations of the decision-making processes behind the adopted models. Evaluations on Defects4J projects show that WITNESS consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across different scenarios. Additionally, WITNESS significantly enhances the efficiency of kill matrix prediction. Post-hoc analysis reveals that features incorporating information from before and after the mutation are the most important among those used in WITNESS. Test case prioritization based on the predicted kill matrix shows that WITNESS delivers results much closer to those obtained by using the actual kill matrix, outperforming baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WITNESS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u548c\u53ea\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u90e8\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "WITNESS\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5185\u5916\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Defects4J\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cWITNESS\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6740\u6b7b\u77e9\u9635\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WITNESS\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5728\u786e\u4fddLLM\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u672a\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A common practice is to assign agents with personas to encourage behavioral diversity. However, this raises a critical yet underexplored question: do personas introduce biases into multi-agent interactions? This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u548c\u575a\u6301\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u504f\u597d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u89c1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u529d\u8bf4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u8868\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u548c\u575a\u6301\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u504f\u597d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u548c\u575a\u6301\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u5904\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u4eba\u683c\uff08\u5982\u7537\u6027\u3001\u767d\u4eba\uff09\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u90a3\u4e48\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u575a\u6301\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u4eba\u683c\u76f8\u540c\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u504f\u597d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u8d77\u91cd\u89c6\u5e76\u91c7\u53d6\u5bf9\u7b56\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

Automated narrative analysis requires deep computational semantic representations along with syntactic processing. Moreover, the large volume of narrative data demands automated semantic analysis and computational learning rather than manual analytical approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework that analyzes the sentiment arcs of movie scripts and performs extended analysis related to the context of the characters involved. The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module. The custom lexicon is based on the Valence, Arousal, and Dominance scores from the NRC-VAD dataset.

However, the widespread adoption of static analysis tools is hindered by their high false alarm rates. Previous studies have introduced the concept of actionable warnings and built a machine-learning method to distinguish actionable warnings from false alarms. However, according to our empirical observation, the current assumption used for actionable warning(s) collection is rather shaky and inaccurate, leading to a large number of invalid actionable warnings. To address this problem, in this study, we build the first large actionable warning dataset by mining 68,274 reversions from Top-500 GitHub C repositories, we then take one step further by assigning each actionable warning a weak label regarding its likelihood of being a real bug. Following that, we propose a two-stage framework called ACWRecommender to automatically recommend the actionable warnings with high probability to be real bugs (AWHB). Our approach warms up the pre-trained model UniXcoder by identifying actionable warnings task (coarse-grained detection stage) and rerank AWHB to the top by weakly supervised learning (fine-grained reranking stage). Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several baselines by a large margin in terms of nDCG and MRR for AWHB recommendation. Moreover, we ran our tool on 6 randomly selected projects and manually checked the top-ranked warnings from 2,197 reported warnings, we reported top-10 recommended warnings to developers, 27 of them were already confirmed by developers as real bugs. Developers can quickly find real bugs among the massive amount of reported warnings, which verifies the practical usage of our tool.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u544a\u8b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6ACWRecommender\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u8b66\u544a\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u666e\u53ca\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u544a\u8b66\u4e0e\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6548\u544a\u8b66\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b68274\u6b21\u4ee3\u7801\u56de\u9000\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u544a\u8b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6761\u544a\u8b66\u8d4b\u4e88\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6ACWRecommender\uff0c\u5148\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u544a\u8b66\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u544a\u8b66\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cACWRecommender\u5728nDCG\u548cMRR\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e6\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u76842197\u6761\u544a\u8b66\uff0c\u524d10\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5df2\u670927\u6761\u88ab\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u786e\u8ba4\u5c5e\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u544a\u8b66\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5feb\u901f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846).

These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability.

Moreover, the digitalised services provided by governmental organisations and companies are governed by an increasing amount of laws and regulations, requiring highly adaptable compliance practices. A potential solution is to automate compliance using software. However, automating compliance is difficult for various reasons. Legal practices involve subjective processes such as interpretation and qualification. New laws and regulations come into effect regularly and laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, are subjected to constant revision. In addition, computational reasoning with laws requires a cross-disciplinary process involving both legal and software expertise.\n  This paper reflects on the domain-specific software language eFLINT developed to experiment with novel solutions. The language combines declarative and procedural elements to reason about situations and scenarios respectively, explicates and formalises connections between legal concepts and computational concepts, and is designed to automate compliance checks both before, during and after a software system runs. The various goals and applications areas for the language give rise to (conflicting) requirements. This paper reflects on the current design of the language by recalling various applications, the requirements they imposed, and subsequent design decisions. As such, this paper reports on results and insights of an investigation that can benefit language developers within the field of automated compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00eFLINT\uff0c\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u53ca\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5408\u89c4\u5b9e\u8df5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u53cd\u601d\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00eFLINT\uff0c\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u5c06\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fd0\u884c\u524d\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u540e\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u5408\u89c4\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86eFLINT\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u89c4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "eFLINT\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u6d1e\u89c1\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u89c4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

The dataset underwent a meticulous multi-stage curation protocol, using a hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis to filter noise and contextually enrich thousands of ambiguous queries. We further augmented the corpus via LLM-driven annotation, classifying questions into seven semantic types to capture user intent. Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness.

Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u89e3\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u5171\u8bc6\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u6982\u7387\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4e0d\u7b49\u4ef7\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e38\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u653e\u5f03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u7684\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6cdb\u5316\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5171\u8bc6\u548c\u653e\u5f03\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728LiveCodeBench\u548cCodeElo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u548cDeepSeek-V3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621%\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6982\u7387\u4f4e\u81f30.14\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u5171\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89e3\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u96be\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens.

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2.

Although many programming languages and frameworks exist, engineers still lack sufficient empirical evidence to guide the choice of tools for advanced industrial applications. This study addresses that need by measuring and comparing worst-case execution time (WCET) and development time across six languages and frameworks: C++, Java, Jade, Jason, and fuzzy Jason BDI with both loosely and tightly coupled integration. These technologies reflect a progression from procedural and object-oriented programming to agent-based frameworks capable of symbolic and fuzzy reasoning.\n  Rather than relying on broad concepts such as paradigms or orientations, the study adopts a developer-centred approach grounded in measurable outcomes. The structured comparison examines how rising abstraction levels and reasoning capabilities affect both development effort and runtime behaviour. By analysing these dimensions, the study highlights concrete trade-offs between engineering workload and execution efficiency.\n  The findings show how abstraction and reasoning mechanisms shape system performance and developer productivity, offering practical insight for designing intelligent, agent-based solutions that must operate under real-time constraints and complex decision-making requirements.

To address this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{CALM}, short for \\textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes.

However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08LLM-MAS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e70\u5356\u53cc\u65b9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u5f0f\u518d\u73b0\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u8d8b\u52bf\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e70\u5356\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u660e\u786e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u8d2d\u4e70\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53ca\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d2d\u4e70\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM-MAS\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u5e02\u573a\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-MAS\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%).

When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u800c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6587\u732e\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4e00\u9879\u5927\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u679027\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u6307\u6807\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u9057\u6f0f\u8bc1\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5b8c\u6574\u62a5\u544a\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u826f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7b5b\u9009\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u52a0\u6743MCC\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u62a5\u544a\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u590d\u5ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found.

Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7740\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u71b5\u662f\u5426\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u57280.5B\u523070B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u6539\u5584\u6781\u5176\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6587\u672c\u672a\u6765\u71b5\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c31\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51cf\u5c11\u71b5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss.

Drawing from a literature review, we identified a set of guidelines for designing software for vulnerable communities and translated these into sixty-two functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements were operationalised through the design of an adaptive early warning system prototype, which was subsequently evaluated through six interviews and eight cognitive walkthroughs to validate their relevance and applicability. The findings demonstrate that human-centric requirements, when addressed early, enhance the usability and accessibility of systems for all users. The paper concludes by positioning human-centricity not as an ethical add-on but as a defining quality of safe and equitable critical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4fa7\u91cd\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u5904\u7684\u4eba\u6587\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u63d0\u70bc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e8662\u6761\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f14\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u9053\u5fb7\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\u3002"}}

They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This \"cognitive shortcutting\" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction.

We find that these files are not static documentation but complex, difficult-to-read artifacts that evolve like configuration code, maintained through frequent, small additions.

However, their direct application to alternative versions often fails due to breaking changes introduced during evolution. These failures stem from both changes in triggering conditions (e.g., API refactorings) and broken dynamic environments (e.g., build or runtime errors), which are challenging to interpret and adapt manually. Existing techniques primarily focus on code-level trace alignment through fuzzing, which is both time-consuming and insufficient for handling environment-level failures. Moreover, they often fall short when dealing with complicated triggering condition changes across versions. To overcome this, we propose Diffploit, an iterative, diff-driven exploit migration method structured around two key modules: the Context Module and the Migration Module. The Context Module dynamically constructs contexts derived from analyzing behavioral discrepancies between the target and reference versions, which capture the failure symptom and its related diff hunks. Leveraging these contexts, the Migration Module guides an LLM-based adaptation through an iterative feedback loop, balancing exploration of diff candidates and gradual refinement to resolve reproduction failures effectively. We evaluate Diffploit on a large-scale dataset containing 102 Java CVEs and 689 version-migration tasks across 79 libraries.

Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u53bb\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u5185\u6db5\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u56db\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b80\u5355\u8bc4\u6d4b\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u8bfb\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively.

The generative and adaptive nature complicates how human oversight and responsibility are specified, delegated, and traced. Existing requirements engineering (RE) approaches remain limited in addressing these phenomena, revealing conceptual, methodological, and artifact-level research gaps.. Objective: This study aims to analyze these research gaps in the context of GenAI-enabled software systems. It seeks to establish a coherent perspective for a systematic analysis of responsibility gaps from a human oversight requirements standpoint, encompassing how these responsibility gaps should be conceptualized, identified, and represented throughout the RE process. Methods: The proposed design methodology is structured across three analytical layers. At the conceptualization layer, it establishes a conceptual framing that defines the key elements of responsibility across the human and system dimensions and explains how potential responsibility gaps emerge from their interactions. At the methodological layer, it introduces a deductive pipeline for identifying responsibility gaps by analyzing interactions between these dimensions and deriving corresponding oversight requirements within established RE frameworks.

Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool.

To address these issues, we introduce **U-MStance**, the first user-centric MCSD dataset, containing over 40k annotated comments across six real-world targets. We further propose **PRISM**, a **P**ersona-**R**easoned mult**I**modal **S**tance **M**odel for MCSD. PRISM first derives longitudinal user personas from historical posts and comments to capture individual traits, then aligns textual and visual cues within conversational context via Chain-of-Thought to bridge semantic and pragmatic gaps across modalities. Finally, a mutual task reinforcement mechanism is employed to jointly optimize stance detection and stance-aware response generation for bidirectional knowledge transfer.

SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAINT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4f01\u4e1aJava\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f01\u4e1aJava\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684OpenAPI\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "SAINT\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2aJava\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cSAINT\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6c34\u5e73\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, large-scale blockchain data collection remains prohibitively expensive, as many RPC providers only offer enhanced APIs with high pricing tiers that are unsuitable for budget-constrained research or industrial-scale applications, which has significantly slowed down academic studies and product development. Moreover, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework that allows flexible integration of new modules for analyzing on-chain data.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce LinkXplore, the first open framework for collecting and managing on-chain data. LinkXplore enables users to bypass costly blockchain data providers by directly analyzing raw data from RPC queries or streams, thereby offering high-quality blockchain data at a fraction of the cost.

With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u853d\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u853d\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u9690\u853d\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8bed\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Debian\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u5bf966\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u793e\u533a\u52a0\u5f3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002"}}

We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement.

This is first and unique end-to-end solution that eliminates routine and resource-intensive problems of processing, creating and visualizing both of explicit and implicit dependencies for prominent SQL dialects on-the-fly. Once launched, FLOWER automatically detects built-in constraints and starting to create own correct and necessary one using dynamic sampling and robust data analysis techniques. This approach applies to improve entity-relationship model and data storytelling to better understand the foundation of data and get unseen insights from DB sources using SQL or natural language. Evaluated on state-of-the-art STATS benchmark, experiments show that FLOWER is superior to reservoir sampling by 2.4x for distribution representation and 2.6x for constraint learning with 2.15x acceleration.

All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing.

This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-G\u00f6del Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Live-SWE-agent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Live-SWE-agent\u4ece\u6700\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528bash\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u6f14\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-bench Verified\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLive-SWE-agent\u8fbe\u523075.4%\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5728SWE-Bench Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4ee545.8%\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u9886\u5148\u3002", "conclusion": "Live-SWE-agent\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u7684\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d625\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u80fd\u529b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2LLM\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u6545\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f83\u5c0fLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLLM\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u4f73\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578bgpt-4.1-mini\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9009\u51fa\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bQwen3-4B\u5e76\u91c7\u7528SFT\u548cGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u6a21\u578bCmprsr\u3002", "result": "Cmprsr\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u5f0f\u548c\u666e\u901a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u538b\u7f29\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e2\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u7684BPMN 2.0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5382\u5546\u9501\u5b9a\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e13\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5382\u5546\u9501\u5b9a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u51c6\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eRML\u7684JSON\u5230RDF/OWL\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u901a\u8fc7Camunda Model API\u751f\u6210BPMN\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf969\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e8692\u4e2aBPMN\u56fe\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe94.2%\uff1b\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5728\u9759\u6001JSON\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\u53cd\u9988\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u5165\u95e8\u57f9\u8bad\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u4e86\u4e13\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5382\u5546\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.\n  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions. We also compare the domain-level information of the two summaries.

Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \\textbf{(1) Load \\& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \\textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference.

Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language. To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage. We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6ILAkkANAM\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65af\u91cc\u5170\u5361\u5b66\u6821\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bd1\u81ea\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e820\u9053\u65af\u91cc\u5170\u5361\u5b66\u6821\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u9898\u76ee\u6309\u4e94\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d61-13\u5e74\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Gemini 2.5\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5e74\u7ea7\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u53cd\u6620\u63a5\u89e6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a0b\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling. Additionally, our findings show that the proposed inference-time probing method offers a reliable metric for assessing the confidence of reward predictions, which ultimately improves the alignment of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08MRMBench\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5404\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u516d\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684MRMBench\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u504f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMRMBench\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u504f\u597d\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u6d4b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

QA-Noun defines nine question templates that cover both explicit syntactical and implicit contextual roles for nouns, producing interpretable QA pairs that complement verbal QA-SRL. We release detailed guidelines, a dataset of over 2,000 annotated noun mentions, and a trained model integrated with QA-SRL to yield a unified decomposition of sentence meaning into individual, highly fine-grained, facts. Evaluation shows that QA-Noun achieves near-complete coverage of AMR's noun arguments while surfacing additional contextually implied relations, and that combining QA-Noun with QA-SRL yields over 130\\% higher granularity than recent fact-based decomposition methods such as FactScore and DecompScore.

Evaluations on six public benchmarks and a real-world business benchmark (NowNewsQA) across three backbone models demonstrate that TAdaRAG outperforms existing methods across diverse domains and long-text tasks, highlighting its strong generalization and practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAdaRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u9700\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u62c6\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u751f\u6210\u865a\u5047\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u68c0\u7d22\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAdaRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u9879\u6a21\u677f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65e0\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e1a\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTAdaRAG\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TAdaRAG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model.

Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.

We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a \"faithfulness gap\": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning \"Houston\" from \"NASA\" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy.

However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six.

This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \\textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods.

We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a dynamic context manager that assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels -- FULL, COMPRESSED, or PLACEHOLDER -- based on semantic similarity to the current query, half-life recency weighting, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline.

In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u53d8\u80fd\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u523b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u53d8\u662f\u5426\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u53d8\u6362\u523b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u957f\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u8bcd\u6570\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Poisson\u53ca\u4e9aPoisson\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u53d8\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u3002\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u53d8\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models.

We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement.

It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578bLDA\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0LDA\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5e76\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LDA\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u8d28\u5408\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884cLDA\uff0850\u6b21\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLDA\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5e76\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "LDA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u6b63\u6355\u6349\u5230\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper provides a systematic review centered on \"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\" (MCoT). First, it analyzes the background and theoretical motivations for its inception from the perspectives of technical evolution and task demands. Then, it introduces mainstream MCoT methods from three aspects: CoT paradigms, the post-training stage, and the inference stage, while also analyzing their underlying mechanisms.

Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall).

Extending Searle's Chinese Room into the multi-modal domain, this paper proposes the Visual Room argument: MLLMs may describe every visual detail precisely yet fail to comprehend the underlying emotions and intentions, namely seeing is not understanding. Building on this, we introduce \\textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\\%$\\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVisual Room\u8bba\u8bc1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLMs)\u867d\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b17\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u6240\u89c1\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\"\u770b\u89c1\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\"\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVisual Room 2.0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6db5\u76d6\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b350\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6837\u672c\u548c2100\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u4ece\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4ef7MLLM\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u6d4b10\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbMLLM\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\"\u770b\u89c1\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\"\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5904\u7406\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u8eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "HCNR\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u5173\u952e\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e94\u4e2aLLM\u65cf\u4e0a\uff0cHCNR\u6062\u590d\u4e8633.25%\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c112.23\u500d\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "HCNR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u540eLLMs\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly.

But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bf1\u5bfc(BLI)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u666e\u904d\u5e94\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u6670\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5426\u5408\u7406\u4e5f\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709BLI\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5728BLI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684\u65b0BLI\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0BLI\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u5de7\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "BLI\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684BLI\u53ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a \"CoT-augmented state prediction\" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover-X1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models, attaining a 37.0\\% average pass rate (pass@32). It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\\% on CombiBench (pass@32).

Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400.

Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation.

During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy.

Standard disfluency correction fails by erroneously deleting valid linguistic information. To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models.

Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\\_r1 and gemini\\_2\\_5\\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability.

Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators.

In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies \"expert\" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights.

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks.

A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts", "comment": null, "summary": "With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PEDIASBench\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u513f\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u3001\u8d34\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u7684PEDIASBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u6cbb\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u533b\u7597\u5b89\u5168\u4f26\u7406\u4e09\u5927\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5305\u62ecGPT-4o\u7b49\u5728\u5185\u768412\u6b3e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca19\u4e2a\u513f\u79d1\u4e9a\u4e13\u79d1\u548c211\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "result": "\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5982Qwen3-235B-A22B\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea615%\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u9898\u76ee\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u4eba\u6587\u5173\u6000\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u513f\u79d1LLM\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u80dc\u4efb\u4e34\u5e8a\u513f\u79d1\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u6587\u5173\u6000\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u53d1\u5c55\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u533b\u7597\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators.

However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.\n  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.\n  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model\n  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,\n  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.\n  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment.

In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes.

To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\\% on spontaneous and 4.8\\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\\% and 18.26\\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6BEA-Large\u548cBEA-Dialogue\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u5206\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u81ea\u53d1\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684ASR\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eFine-tuned Fast Conformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u8fbe\u523014.18%\uff08\u81ea\u53d1\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\u548c4.8%\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\uff1b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e3a13.05%-18.26%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios.

Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u865a\u5047\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u5047\u8bc4\u8bba\u8bef\u5bfc\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u3001\u635f\u5bb3\u5546\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8a89\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6240\u76f4\u89c2\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u6613\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7528LLMs\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u865a\u5047\u8bc4\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9690\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76f4\u89c2\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u865a\u5047\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u8bba\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff08TAI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u8bd7\u6b4c\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u975e\u6bcd\u8bed\u8bfb\u8005\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u8bd7\u6b4c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1TAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d54\u7387\u6bd4\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u8bd7\u6b4c\u51c6\u786e\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6bd4\u55bb\u4e0e\u5176\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bd7\u6b4c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "TAI\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bd7\u6b4c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b21\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u76841570\u9996\u8bd7\u6b4c\u7684MorphoVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u8bd7\u6b4c\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5168\u7403\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8bfb\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002"}}

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Lang1\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u8fd0\u8425\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6ReMedE\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Lang1\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLang1\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ece1\u4ebf\u523070\u4ebf\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u5b66Langone\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u768480B\u4e34\u5e8a\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c627B\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e668,331\u6761EHR\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6ReMedE\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540eLang1-1B\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6bd4\u5176\u592770\u500d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0cAUROC\u63d0\u53473.64%-6.75%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u8fbe23.66%\u3002\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u9662\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185EHR\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4e13\u95e8\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edfAI\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}
