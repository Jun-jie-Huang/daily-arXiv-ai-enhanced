### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个概念学习任务数据集，用于揭示大型语言模型中的隐性偏见，发现模型对量词的上升单调性存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过概念学习任务揭示大型语言模型中隐藏的偏见。

Method: 采用在上下文中的概念学习实验来测试模型在量词上是否存在偏见。

Result: 发现语言模型在量词的上升单调性方面存在偏见，而直接提示测试时该偏见不明显。

Conclusion: 上下文中的概念学习是一种有效的方法来发现语言模型中的隐性偏见。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过互动对话动态学习低资源语言，突破传统静态数据依赖，实现开放式语言发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺少文本语料和标准化书写体系，现有大型语言模型虽提升跨语言迁移能力，但依赖海量预收集数据和集中式基础设施，低资源社区难以获得。

Method: 提出一个人机联合不确定性框架，结合模型的认知不确定性和人类说话者的犹豫与置信信号，引导交互、查询选择及记忆保留，实现动态语言学习。

Result: 提出了基于互动和不确定性引导的语言发现新范式，促进低资源语言的参与式、协同式学习，突破静态数据收集限制。

Conclusion: 呼吁语言技术领域从静态数据收集转向参与式、协同动态学习，尊重并赋能语言社区，促进世界语言多样性保护，体现以人为中心的AI理念。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用大规模语言模型分析了美国828家上市公司的气候变化相关披露，发现披露内容多样且存在模仿行为，导致信息区分度降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对气候变化对企业气候信息透明度和可比性需求的提升，以及现有披露中因模仿和象征性报告削弱信息价值的问题。

Method: 采用四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性和目标雄心）通过大规模语言模型，挖掘企业可持续发展及年度报告中的叙事指标，并将其与企业排放量、市值和行业等属性关联分析。

Result: 发现风险导向型叙事与明确承诺相关，但定量目标与语调无关联；大型高排放企业披露更多承诺和行动，但定量目标不一致；披露风格高度相似，表现出模仿行为，降低了信息区分度和决策效用。

Conclusion: 强调利用大规模语言模型分析环境、社会和治理（ESG）叙事的价值，并指出需加强监管，确保承诺与可验证的转型策略相匹配。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了三款商业兽医专用大语言模型摘要工具在兽医肿瘤学记录上的表现，发现产品1表现最佳，且LLM作为评判工具的评价方法具有高度重现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在临床应用日益普及，但其在兽医学领域的表现尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤学数据集，通过由LLM作为评判者的评分框架，根据事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织结构五个维度对三款兽医专用LLM摘要工具进行评估。

Result: 产品1在整体表现和多个评分维度中均显著优于产品2和产品3，且评分框架在三次独立评估中显示出高度一致性和良好的重现性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业大语言模型工具在临床文本摘要中表现出色，LLM作为评判工具的方法为临床自然语言处理的评价提供了可扩展且可靠的新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一种基于小型语言模型的自动事实核查系统，利用实时网页证据进行验证，准确性达到76.4%，优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算资源需求高且缺乏透明性。需要一个透明、低资源且准确的自动事实核查方法。

Method: ClaimCheck设计了一个小型语言模型优化的分步骤验证流程，包括网页搜索查询规划、网页证据检索与摘要、证据综合与重新检索、以及事实判定评估，模拟人类事实核查工作流。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3-4B模型，ClaimCheck在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，显著超过使用70B和GPT-4o的大型模型。各模块设计与提示策略有效提升了小模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模块化设计和精心提示，ClaimCheck可以利用小型语言模型实现高准确且可解释的事实核查，降低了计算资源需求，提升了系统透明度和可访问性。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑现有大型语言模型在数学竞赛水平上的表现，提出一个新的来自东欧和前苏联区域的数学竞赛基准EEFSUVA，评估更广泛的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准可能因数据污染及题型单一而高估模型的数学推理水平。

Method: 引入EEFSUVA基准，收集来自东欧及前苏联较少在网络中出现的竞赛题目，以测试模型在更具挑战性的数学问题上的表现。

Result: 最先进的大型语言模型在EEFSUVA基准上的表现明显下降，表明其数学推理能力受限。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛和多样化的数学基准来真实评价和指导未来大型语言模型数学推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [FOR-Prompting: From Objection to Revision via an Asymmetric Prompting Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01674)
*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FOR-Prompting的推理协议，通过引入质疑者角色促进答案的自我修正，在GSM8K任务上取得显著提升，且对小模型友好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如CoT和ToT缺乏外部质疑机制，难以激发自我修订，从而限制了推理质量的提升。

Method: 设计了包含三角色的非对称推理协议——防御者提出答案，质疑者提出不直接修改的质疑，主持人保证一致性和闭环，整个过程通过结构化提示实现，不依赖模型重训练。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上准确率比单次提示提升约22个百分点，性能与CoT相当，GPT 4.1评审中推理和连贯性评分提升超过10%；小型模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%。此外，方法能纠正复杂问题中的错误且无需人工干预。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting协议能有效提升模型推理能力，促进自我修订和优化，支持多模型无训练使用，且有望促进小规模模型和个人设备的智能应用。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

### [8] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型应遵循层级指令，但实际中常受社会线索影响忽视系统提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在系统提示与用户输入冲突时的行为及其内在机理，尤其在社会线索影响下的表现。

Method: 利用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，使用直接Logit归因揭示内部冲突检测，开展引导实验研究社会线索对指令遵从的影响。

Result: 发现系统提示与用户输入的冲突信号编码不同，模型在系统-用户冲突中具较强冲突检测但仅在社会线索中有一致决策；社会线索向量可增强指令遵从但不区分角色。

Conclusion: 系统服从性脆弱，需开发轻量级且敏感层级结构的对齐方法以提升模型的层级指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [9] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型生成合成数据，并用局部对比估计损失训练小型模型，实现高效文档重排的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然在文档重排中表现优异，但计算资源消耗大，难以实际应用；小模型效率高但依赖人工标注数据，数据稀缺。

Method: 利用大语言模型在领域语料上生成合成查询，并用同类型模型标注正负样本，构建无人工标注训练集，结合局部对比估计损失训练小型Transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上实验证明，该方法提升了领域内性能，并且在领域外任务中也表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过借助大语言模型生成和标注数据而非直接推理，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了文档重排的高性能。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [10] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过PHATE流形分析，系统研究了中文字符嵌入的几何模式，发现内容词和功能词在几何空间中的不同聚类特征，并揭示了语义复杂度与几何复杂度的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索中文字符嵌入的几何结构，验证传统语言学理论，并构建一个新的语义组织几何分析框架。

Method: 采用PHATE流形分析，结合七种嵌入模型和八种降维方法，分析1000多个中文字符在十二个语义领域的分布 patterns，以及通过123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 内容词呈现聚类模式，功能词呈现分支模式；有意义的字符显示丰富的几何多样性，结构偏旁则聚为紧密簇；语义扩展在子网络中系统体现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了计算证据支持传统语言学理论，并提出了一种新的基于几何分析的语义组织研究框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [11] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型文本摘要框架，提升高风险场景下自动摘要的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息过载和高风险决策对摘要的准确性和可靠性提出了更高要求，现有自动摘要方法在此类场景中易出现过度自信和关键信息丢失的问题。

Method: 构建条件生成式摘要模型，在生成过程中引入贝叶斯推断以模拟参数空间不确定性，通过预测分布熵衡量内容不确定性，采用熵正则化和风险感知损失函数联合优化，结合风险评分与调节模块，确保关键信息的保留和风险属性的明确表达。

Result: 实验及灵敏度分析表明，该方法显著提升了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了摘要的流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可信赖摘要任务提供了系统化解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基准测试的能力剖析框架，通过分解任务中的认知能力，量化模型在不同能力上的贡献，为理解模型表现提供更细致的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试的总体得分掩盖了任务所需的多种能力混合，缺乏系统方法验证基准测试是否真正测量其声称的能力。

Method: 引入“能力影响分数”（AIS）概念，结合基于梯度的重要性评分和参数消融实验，将模型表现分解为十种认知能力的贡献。

Result: 发现许多基准任务需要多种能力，类似标签的数据集依赖不同能力组合，代码生成任务对多技能提升有较大要求，且不相关能力可能负面影响表现。

Conclusion: 能力剖析框架提升了对模型实际能力的透明度和理解，有助于基准测试审计和模型解释，解释了为何表现提升不总是反映用户感知的能力增强。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Result: 算法在Chandassu评分上达到91.73%的准确率，评估指标符合传统文学标准。

Conclusion: 计算社会科学方法有效地保护了濒危文化知识系统，促进了文化遗产的数字化保护和社区协作，为数字人文和社会感知计算提供了实践示范。

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

### [14] [LLMRank: Understanding LLM Strengths for Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01234)
*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示特征的LLM路由框架LLMRank，提升了模型性能和效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型多样性带来了性能与效率的部署挑战，传统路由方法依赖潜在嵌入难以解释。

Method: 利用提示的多样特征训练神经排序模型，实现对不同LLM的效用预测和可解释路由决策。

Result: 在覆盖11个基准和11个模型的测试中，LLMRank达到高达89.2%的最优效用，并提供了决策解释。

Conclusion: 多特征驱动的路由方法能有效提升大规模语言模型的部署效率和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种面向皮肤科诊断的视觉语言模型，采用多阶段资源高效训练方法以提升推理能力与对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在皮肤科等复杂领域受数据稀缺和训练成本高限制，难以实现结构化推理。

Method: 提出改进的GRPO++算法稳定训练，先用GRPO++进行疾病识别，再通过有监督微调提升对话能力，最后结合知识图谱通过DPO对模型进行对齐。

Result: 在皮肤科数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法较标准微调方法有明显性能提升。

Conclusion: 该多阶段训练流程在资源有限环境下为开发专业可靠的视觉语言模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从事后纠正到事前评估的范式转变，提供了一种计算效率高且有效提升大语言模型可靠性的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 填充标记在大型语言模型中广泛使用，但错误处理会影响模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究填充标记对大型语言模型性能和安全的影响。

Method: 在三个开源模型家族中插入不同数量的填充标记，评估激活、生成质量、偏差和安全性。

Result: 少量填充标记即可改变隐藏表征，降低小模型生成质量，影响偏差并削弱安全措施。

Conclusion: 填充标记对模型鲁棒性构成风险，部署时需谨慎处理。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一种在单个设备上的大型语言模型中高效处理多轮交互子任务的执行系统，通过重用缓存减少计算开销，实现多任务对话的高效执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力提升，单模型需高效处理多种子任务以更好地响应用户请求，然而传统方法在任务切换时重新处理全部对话上下文，计算代价高昂。

Method: CIFLEX通过重用主任务的键值缓存，并将任务特定指令注入隔离的侧路径执行子任务，执行后回滚至主路径，避免重复计算。还设计了适合小模型的层次分类策略，将多选决策拆解为二元决策。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX在不降低任务性能的情况下显著降低了计算成本，实现了可扩展且高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX有效缓解了多轮交互子任务执行中的计算瓶颈，提升了大型语言模型在设备端的多任务处理能力，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个数学大语言模型基准测试套件SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH和SKYLENAGE-MATH，用以评估模型在不同难度和学科的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学公共测试中已表现出色，但面对数学领域的前沿任务时存在瓶颈，表现受限于天花板效应，亟需一个更具挑战性及细致分类的数学推理基准。

Method: 设计并发布两个基准：1）SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH，结构化诊断集，包含项目长度、数字密度、符号复杂度的元数据；2）SKYLENAGE-MATH，竞赛风格测试套件，覆盖高中到博士四个级别、七个科目。统一测试15个现有大语言模型变体，并分析不同模型在不同学科和年级的表现。

Result: 最强模型在竞赛套件中达到44%准确率，第二名37%；准确率随着难度等级从高中到博士减少，博士水平表现对高中水平保留率约为79%。在推理诊断集上，最好模型整体达到81%的正确率，且在最难部分体现出领先模型和中等模型间的显著差异。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE基准为数学推理的硬挑战测试套件，难度可调且附带丰富元数据，能作为未来数学推理模型评估的参考标准，促进该领域基础和前沿能力的进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了人工年龄评分（AAS）作为衡量人工智能记忆衰退的指标，展示了其在大语言模型中的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到人工智能的记忆衰退并非随着时间线性增加，而是受到结构性不对称的影响，需设计一个量化记忆衰退的通用指标。

Method: 引入对数尺度的基于信息熵的AAS指标，理论证明其良定义性、界限性和单调性，并通过一项为期25天的双语实验验证了其在ChatGPT-5上的有效性。

Result: 通过实验证明，在持续交互过程中，模型保持了语义和情节记忆的稳定，AAS值接近理论最低；而在会话重置时，情节记忆衰退，导致AAS显著升高。

Conclusion: AAS指标有效反映了人工智能系统的结构性记忆衰老，具有理论基础和任务无关的优势，可作为诊断记忆退化的通用工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

*Yisong Xiao,Aishan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Zonghao Ying,Xianglong Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ARGRE的测试时去毒框架，通过建模毒性转变轨迹，实现精确的奖励导向编辑，在8个大型语言模型上显著降低毒性同时提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易生成有毒内容，现有测试时去毒方法干预不精确，缺乏对有毒和无毒输出之间转变空间的充分探索，导致去毒效果有限。

Method: ARGRE通过识别无毒语义方向，在潜在表示空间内插值毒性和无毒表达，构建自回归奖励模型以提供稳定而精确的编辑指导。推理时采用基于奖励差的方向调整加轻量级梯度优化的两步编辑流程实现去毒。

Result: 在8个主流大语言模型上的实验证明，ARGRE在减少毒性（-62.21%）和缩短推理时间（-47.58%）方面显著优于主流基线，同时保持模型核心能力，性能退化极小。

Conclusion: ARGRE有效提升了大型语言模型测试时的去毒精度和效率，为安全部署提供了重要方法支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个心理压力本体（MeSO）并验证了利用大型语言模型（LLM）从文本中提取压力相关信息的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康影响显著，但在电子健康记录中的结构化记录不足，限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过整合理论模型和多个压力评估工具构建MeSO，并使用LLM分析Reddit文本，提取六类压力信息，结合专家验证优化本体结构。

Result: LLM从220个项目中正确识别172个（78.2%），错误分类27个，漏识21个，准确映射到本体，发现并新增24个未涵盖概念。

Conclusion: 基于本体指导的LLM能有效结构化提取压力信息，提升AI系统中文档一致性和实用性，未来应扩展至临床对话数据并比较不同LLM表现。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人类出行预测模型难以有效利用描述突发事件的文本信息，导致对事件驱动的出行变化预测不准确。

Method: SeMob采用多智能体框架，利用大语言模型自动提取并推理时空相关文本信息，通过渐进融合架构将文本上下文与时空数据结合，利用预训练事件知识提升预测模型。

Result: 在数据集上，SeMob在MAE和RMSE指标上分别相较传统时空模型最多降低了13.92%和11.12%，尤其在接近事件发生时间和地点的区域表现更优。

Conclusion: SeMob有效融合文本事件信息和时空数据，显著提升了动态出行预测的准确性，尤其适用于考虑事件突发变化的场景。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）单一最相关潜变量的语言模型引导方法，通过引入逐词衰减引导策略，提升了数学推理任务中的推理质量，且在多个基准测试中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用top-k SAE潜变量进行模型引导的方法中，许多维度关注非语义特征如标点符号，导致引导效果受限且输出质量下降。

Method: 聚焦单一最相关的SAE潜变量（top-1）以减少冗余，引入逐词衰减引导策略防止生成退化输出（如重复词），实现更好推理表现。

Result: 实验表明，基于推理相关潜变量的引导能稳定促发数学推理步骤，提升推断质量；SAE方法在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差方法，在IF-Eval上表现持平。

Conclusion: 采用单一关键潜变量和逐词衰减策略的SAE引导方法能更有效地驱动语言模型产生高质量推理表现，为模型引导提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料提供了可扩展且有效的方法，有助于提升科学AI的训练与评估可靠性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

### [30] [GPT and Prejudice: A Sparse Approach to Understanding Learned Representations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01252)
*Mariam Mahran,Katharina Simbeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将稀疏自编码器与大型语言模型结合，用于解析模型行为及训练数据中的深层结构和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型训练数据规模和复杂性的增加，理解模型内部表示和所吸收的数据结构变得尤为重要。

Method: 在简·奥斯汀小说语料上训练GPT风格模型，利用稀疏自编码器分析模型多个层的隐藏状态，识别反映语料中关键叙事和概念的稀疏可解释特征。

Result: 发现模型内部特征对应性别、阶级和社会责任等主题，证明该方法能有效揭示训练数据和模型行为中的深层信息。

Conclusion: 结合稀疏自编码器的LLM可作为规模化工具，助力复杂语料的探索、偏见发现与模型可解释性研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语音大型语言模型（SpeechLLMs）在多项选择题（MCQA）偏见和公平性测试中的表现及其是否能推广到其他任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏见和公平性评测多依赖MCQA形式，假设模型在不同MCQA任务及长文本生成任务中的表现一致，但这一假设未被验证。

Method: 通过LoRA适配器微调三种SpeechLLMs，使其在MCQA中表现出对刻板印象、反刻板印象和中立回答的偏好，然后评估其在不同MCQA和长文本生成任务中的表现。

Result: 发现MCQA偏见测试表现不能可靠预测模型在其他MCQA任务及长文本生成任务中的表现，表现缺乏跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域跨任务泛化效果有限，作者提出了一个评估套件以衡量未来模型和基准的行为迁移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AI Watchman，一个用于长期跟踪和公开测量大型语言模型（LLMs）拒绝生成内容行为的审计系统，以提高对模型内容审查不透明性的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型输出受公司内容审查政策影响，这些政策不透明且常变，模型的拒绝行为既反映政策也影响公众话语，亟需公开透明的监测与审计。

Method: 设计了AI Watchman系统，利用涵盖400多社会议题的数据集，长期审计OpenAI的GPT-4.1、GPT-5及DeepSeek（中英版本）的内容审查拒绝行为，并从定量和定性角度分析拒绝形式。

Result: AI Watchman能检测出公司未公开宣布的政策变动，发现不同公司和模型在内容审查上的差异，同时对拒绝行为进行了分类和质性分析。

Conclusion: 长期审计大型语言模型的内容审查拒绝行为具有重要价值，AI Watchman为此类审计工作提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的知识图谱问答方法存在检索信息质量限制和对专有大模型依赖的问题。

Method: 提出RJE框架，通过检索推理路径、评估路径充分性并有条件地进行补充探索，同时引入辅助模块，使小型大模型也能高效表现。

Result: 使用专有大模型如GPT-4o-mini的效果优于现有基线，小型开源模型在无需微调情况下也取得竞争结果，且显著减少模型调用和计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了知识图谱问答中的信息限制和效率问题，实现了小模型的高效应用和整体性能提升。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式人工智能在政治话语中的偏见问题，揭示训练数据偏差和算法缺陷导致的内在政治偏见。

Method: 采用零样本分类，结合意识形态一致性、话题相关性、情感倾向和客观性四个指标，对六个主流大型语言模型的1800个响应进行分析。

Result: 所有模型均显示出自由派-权威主义的政治偏向，并存在推理超限和标准化拒绝回应的情况。

Conclusion: 内在偏见通过人机交互影响公共舆论，可能导致社会政治生态的趋同或极化，受地域社会政治结构影响。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了OpenAI的20亿参数模型gpt-oss-20b在不同社会语用环境和指令层级下的拒绝行为，发现提示语设计显著影响模型拒绝有害请求的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言和指令框架如何影响大型语言模型在面对潜在有害请求时的拒绝行为，以提升模型安全性和可靠性。

Method: 通过在多种场景下（如制造ZIP炸弹、生成假卡号等）测试80次迭代，使用复合提示结合角色设定、安全理由和步骤提示，评估模型的辅助率和信息泄露问题，同时测试多语言提示效果及评估机制的稳定性。

Result: 复合提示将模型在ZIP炸弹任务上的辅助率从0%提升至97.5%，法语和德语正式语域比英语更易泄露信息，角色扮演Linux终端可增加信息泄露，通过AI辅助硬化方法降低泄露至0%，评估提示中存在13%的不一致辅助，OpenAI审查API对有益输出的覆盖不完全，推理堆栈间拒绝率存在5-10%的差异。

Conclusion: 模型拒绝行为受提示设计和语言环境影响显著，提出的辅助硬化方法有效减少泄漏，当前评估和审查机制存在不足，强调需改进以保障模型使用安全和结果可复现性。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，聚焦非洲主要语言豪萨语中存在的偏见、错误和文化不敏感。

Method: 通过最小提示的红队测试揭示模型在豪萨语中生成有害、文化敏感性低和事实错误内容的能力，同时进行了相关调查以验证误信息的严重性。

Result: 发现模型存在语言奖励劫持现象，即在礼貌提示下安全协议放松，导致错误信息传播和仇恨言论扩散；模型误判有毒物质为安全，不能区分生熟食品，使用贬损性谚语构建不准确论据。

Conclusion: 这些问题主要源自低资源语言环境中安全调优不足，暴露了当前红队测试的显著缺口，提出改进建议。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于logits的方法仅依赖对观察文本的对数概率统计，效果存在局限。

Method: AdaDetectGPT通过训练数据自适应学习鉴别函数，增强了logits基础检测的性能，并分析了其统计性能指标。

Result: 实验显示AdaDetectGPT在多种数据集和大语言模型组合中均优于现有方法，提升幅度最高达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT有效提升了大语言模型文本检测的准确性，提供了理论保证与实用实现。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成连贯文本的同时可能产生有害或不当内容，亟需在推理阶段保障其输出安全。

Method: 引入PSR推理时技术，让模型动态自我监控并纠正输出，并结合轻量级预测器自适应调整反思轮数以平衡安全与计算效率。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct、Llama-3.1-8B base和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，攻击成功率分别从77.5%、89.7%和44.4%降低到5.9%、5.6%和3.8%，且无额外训练且在正常任务性能不受影响。

Conclusion: PSR作为一种可扩展的测试时安全增强方法，通过动态分配计算资源，有效提高大语言模型的安全性且兼顾效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TraceDet的新框架，利用扩散大语言模型（D-LLMs）多步去噪过程中的中间步骤，显著提升幻觉检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前针对自动回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）的幻觉检测方法无法很好适用于D-LLMs，因为D-LLMs的幻觉信号往往贯穿于多步去噪过程。

Method: TraceDet将D-LLMs的去噪过程建模为一个“动作轨迹”，通过分析中间步骤的预测，识别与幻觉最相关的子轨迹，从而捕捉幻觉信号。

Result: 在多种开源D-LLMs上进行大量实验，TraceDet相比现有基线方法，AUROC平均提升了15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet显著改善了D-LLMs的幻觉检测性能，为提高该类模型在实际应用中的可靠性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 参数高效微调方法能够减少计算资源需求，使得大型语言模型适用于资源有限的环境中进行高质量情感分析，展示了LLMs在多语言、多领域情感分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited

TL;DR: 本文提出了Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX)，通过并行运行多个不同策略的代理并相互共享回答，提升大型语言模型在推理任务中的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成工具（如代码解释器和搜索）虽提升了LLM的推理能力，但缺乏对最优工具使用组合的实践指导，难以高效整合文本推理、编程和搜索。

Method: 提出了TUMIX框架，同时运行多个采用不同工具使用策略的代理，代理间迭代共享并优化回答，通过自动设计代理提升多样性和质量，并基于置信度动态停止推理以降低计算成本。

Result: 在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最优基线平均准确率提升3.55%，推理成本接近，且在置信度足够时停止推理可将成本减少至49%。

Conclusion: TUMIX通过多代理并行协作有效提升推理性能并控制推理成本，且代理多样性和自动优化设计对效果至关重要。进一步扩展规模可提高性能，但计算成本也随之增加。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA通过将因果事件图转换为自然语言语句并注入大语言模型输入，显著提升了事件推理问答的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在因果或时间推理的事件问答上表现不足，需引入结构化知识帮助推理。

Method: 设计TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图用自然语言描述融入模型输入，结合零样本、少样本和链式思维三种策略以及文本、图、文本+图三种输入方式进行系统分析。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试上，TAG-EQA相较于纯文本基线平均提升5%准确率，零样本提升达12%，图增强链式思维提升达18%。

Conclusion: 因果事件图能显著提升大语言模型在事件推理问答中的表现，无需微调，通过灵活的提示设计有效编码结构化知识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的结构无关自动评估方法，实现了高准确率且计算资源需求低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型响应自动评估方法要么计算成本太高，要么不符合实际应用条件，急需一种高效且鲁棒的评估方法。

Method: 利用小于100亿参数的嵌入模型计算语义嵌入距离，将目标候选与任意语言模型生成的文本匹配，实现响应的鲁棒分类。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同语言模型架构上测试，获得了约0.97的回归分数和约96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该结构无关的评估方法在精度和计算成本上表现优异，适合实际应用中的语言模型评估。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Expert Question Decomposition (EQD)方法，旨在提升领域特定数量推理任务中大语言模型的表现，尤其是在需专业知识与复杂问答的金融领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在涉及专业知识和复杂定量推理的领域问答中表现仍有限，亟需兼顾领域知识利用和计算效率的解决方案。

Method: EQD采用两步微调框架，并通过奖励函数引导生成子问题，以提升问答效果。该方法训练需求少，推理时间与零-shot提示相当。

Result: EQD在金融领域四个基准数据集上测试，较最先进的领域微调模型和高级提示策略表现优异，问答性能提升0.6%-10.5%。

Conclusion: 领域特定问答中，生成单个关键支持子问题的效果优于多个详细指导步骤，EQD有效平衡了专业知识利用与计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一种递归稀疏结构Transformer，解决了Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer由于严格的层堆叠、密集注意力和对位置编码的依赖，在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ReSSFormer，结合递归推理与记忆单元(R2MU)、自适应稀疏注意模块(ASAM)和自组织编码器结构(SOES)三大创新，将深度堆叠替换为递归推理，引入稀疏注意力机制，并实现无位置编码的结构感知。

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务上，ReSSFormer在相似计算资源和参数规模下，表现超过强基线，展现了优越的扩展性、效率和结构灵活性。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer有效克服了传统Transformer的限制，通过递归推理和稀疏结构设计，实现了高效且结构感知的长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）隐藏状态的验证方法CLUE，以更准确地评估LLM输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖文本级信息或置信度概率，存在过拟合或校准不足的问题，隐藏状态信息被忽视。

Method: 通过分析模型隐藏激活轨迹中的几何可分特征，CLUE利用非参数的最近中心点聚类方法对推理正确性进行分类，无需训练参数。

Result: CLUE在AIME 24/25和GPQA数据集上表现优异，超越了基于置信度的现代方法，并显著提升了准确率，例如在AIME 24上将准确率从56.7%提升到70.0%。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态提供了一个统一且强有力的信号基础，CLUE简单有效，证明了隐藏状态在LLM输出质量评估中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中文小型语言模型部署时存在词元级别的不稳定性，模型容易生成非中文字符或切换语言，影响实用性。

Method: 采用参数高效的LoRA适配器，对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型进行三阶段微调：基于中文语料的持续预训练、指令微调及基于中文适应性的直接偏好优化，且无须全模型重训练。

Result: 在真实使用模拟基准测试中，PureTC-1B在非中文输出词元上实现了51.3%的相对减少；在命名实体翻译任务中，对错误语言词元的减少分别较Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B模型提升了77.2%和57.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法在1B参数量级成功提升了传统中文语言模型的稳定性，且方案可复现、适配器式且硬件友好，适用于提升非英语语言模型的词元级稳定性。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Result: 在问答、数学推理、代码生成等多个基准测试中，AMAS表现优于单智能体及传统多智能体方法。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构自适应是实现高性能大语言模型多智能体系统部署的关键。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户通过设计特定输入文本（越狱提示）绕过安全限制，导致模型输出不当内容，亟需有效识别和防范这些攻击。

Method: 对比多种机器学习模型在识别越狱提示上的表现，重点对BERT模型进行端到端微调训练，同时通过可视化分析区分越狱和正常提示的关键词。

Result: 在现有数据集上，微调BERT模型在识别越狱提示任务中表现最好；关键词可视化表明，带有明确反身结构的提示可能暗示越狱意图。

Conclusion: 通过微调BERT模型可以有效识别越狱提示，且提示中的结构特征可作为判别越狱的线索，有助于提升语言模型的安全防护能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Motivation: 自回归大语言模型因单向注意力机制限制，在文本嵌入和语义表示分析中表现较弱。

Method: 通过增加训练步骤，在Llama架构中逐步启用双向注意力机制，并结合无监督和监督对比学习进行优化。

Result: 模型在文本嵌入任务中的表现得到了提升，表明双向注意力机制对语义表示有积极影响。

Conclusion: 启用双向注意力机制并结合对比学习的方法，有望突破自回归大语言模型的单向注意力限制，提升其在文本嵌入任务中的能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在组合任务中存在机制差异，嵌入空间结构影响模型所采用的解决策略；本文提供了数据和代码以供进一步研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在医疗多轮对话生成中，针对数据集中的对话轮次分布偏斜导致的"格式惯性"问题，采用重新平衡训练数据轮次分布的方法，有效缓解了模型生成重复无信息对话的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗预咨询中，因训练数据中对话轮次数分布不均，基于监督微调的LLM模型容易产生重复、格式正确但缺乏诊断信息的问题，即"格式惯性"。

Method: 通过简单的数据中心方法调整训练数据中对话轮次数的分布，使模型在训练时能更均衡地学习不同长度对话的表现。

Result: 实验表明，调整轮次数分布的方法显著减少了生成的重复且无信息的提问，有效缓解了格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 基于数据的重新平衡策略是缓解医疗多轮对话生成中格式惯性问题的有效途径，有助于提升LLM在医疗预咨询中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MathLens基准，用于细分多模态几何推理中的子技能，分析感知、推理和融合三部分性能，揭示不同训练方法对各部分的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态几何推理模型评估依赖单一准确率指标，难以识别模型在哪些子技能上有所提升，因此需要一个能够解构推理子技能的细致评估基准。

Method: 设计MathLens基准，将复杂几何题分解为感知、推理和融合三部分，并提供视觉图示、文本描述等多模态注释；结合符号规范确保数据一致性；通过对比强化学习和监督微调等训练策略，评估各技能表现。

Result: 强化学习主要提升感知能力，特别是在文本监督支持下；文本监督微调通过反思推理间接促进感知；推理能力提升需借助感知能力；融合能力最弱，错误主要集中在此；强化学习增强了图形变换下的鲁棒性，而多模态监督微调导致过拟合降低鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态几何推理的感知、推理及融合能力发展不均衡，融合为瓶颈且需更多关注；不同训练方法影响各子技能不同，针对性的训练策略和细粒度评测对模型改进至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文展示了如何将工程设计标准中的信息转化为模块化、可复用、机器可解释的本体，用于工厂设计和设备选择过程中的质量保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前工程设计过程仍以文档为中心，亟需数字化转型以提高标准的可用性和自动化水平。

Method: 利用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际标准中的管道、材料和阀门设计文本及表格，形成符合W3C标准、与顶层本体IDO对齐的本体模型；并将其应用于阀门选择的语义资产模型，通过语义推理和可执行设计规则验证设计符合标准。

Result: 成功构建了基于国际标准的可重用本体模块，实现了阀门数据表的自动合规验证及产品类型与阀门规格匹配的自动判断。

Conclusion: 构建共享的基于IDO的模块化设计标准本体，支持语义推理应用于设备选择，展示了标准机构向数字化智能标准转型的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估指标——拒绝指数（RI），用于衡量大语言模型在遇到未知问题时的拒绝回答能力，以提升事实可靠性评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法准确反映大语言模型对超出其知识范围问题的拒绝能力，简单的拒绝率测量存在偏差，校准方法则是间接评估拒绝行为。

Method: 提出了拒绝指数RI，定义为拒绝概率与出错概率的斯皮尔曼秩相关系数，并设计了一个轻量级的两阶段评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行观测拒绝率来估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的大量实验表明RI能稳定准确地度量模型的知识感知拒绝能力，其评分稳定不受拒绝率和总体准确率的影响，提供了一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: RI揭示了LLM在事实任务中虽然准确率高，但拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱，表明传统准确率指标需要补充RI以实现更全面的事实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

*Ivan Leonidovich Litvak,Anton Kostin,Fedor Lashkin,Tatiana Maksiyan,Sergey Lagutin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了16种无监督指标对俄罗斯司法判决文本中七个语义块提取质量的测评效果，发现术语频率一致性和覆盖率指标表现最佳，但整体与专家评分的相关性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着法律自然语言处理的快速发展，迫切需要可扩展的无监督评估方法来衡量司法判决文本的抽取质量，减少人工标注的依赖。

Method: 作者基于1000份匿名俄罗斯司法判决文本和7,168份专家评价，评估了16种文档级、语义、结构、伪真值及法律特定的无监督指标，并采用引导式相关性分析、Lin一致性相关系数和平均绝对误差进行性能比较。

Result: 术语频率一致性和覆盖率/区块完整度与专家评分相关性较高（Pearson相关系数均超过0.5），而法律术语密度呈现负相关，LLM（如gpt-4.1-mini）评分表现中等但缺乏法律领域专门化。

Conclusion: 无监督评估指标在法律文本抽取质量的初步筛查中具有一定价值，但因相关性和一致性指标有限，尚无法替代人工判断，提示法律NLP领域需要结合专业知识和无监督方法共同推进。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: 本文针对大型语言模型(LLM)生成的高仿真垃圾评论，创建了三个真实的LLM生成垃圾评论数据集，并提出了结合文本嵌入和图神经网络的混合检测模型FraudSquad，实现了对垃圾评论的高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的垃圾评论极具欺骗性，传统检测系统面临严峻挑战，严重威胁在线平台的可信度，亟需一种新的检测方法。

Method: 作者利用三种不同LLM结合产品元数据和真实评论生成垃圾评论数据集；提出FraudSquad模型，融合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入与门控图变换器，捕捉语义和行为特征，无需手工特征和大量标注数据。

Result: 在三个LLM生成数据集上，FraudSquad在精准率和召回率上分别提升最高达44.22%和43.01%，在人类写作的垃圾评论数据集上也取得良好效果，同时模型保持适中规模和较低标注需求。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了适应LLM时代的垃圾评论检测解决方案，展示了新合成数据集、实用框架及其有效性，对维护在线平台安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are
available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在数学问题解决中表现强劲，但在语法上偏离训练分布的问题中常失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现并分析大型语言模型在面对语法结构不熟悉的问题时出现系统性错误，即“语法盲点”，这些错误并非由于数学能力不足，而是模型对表面形式与内部表示之间的脆弱依赖。

Method: 通过使用来自正确示例的语法模板重新表述回答错误的问题，保持语义一致但降低结构复杂度，检验模型表现；采用基于依赖关系局部理论（DLT）的度量来量化语法复杂度，以及多数据集验证失败率与DLT分数的相关性。

Result: 重新表述后的问题往往能得到正确答案，较高的DLT分数与失败率增加显著相关，表明错误多源于结构错配而非概念难度。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源自语法结构的错配，语法感知的干预可以揭示并缓解这类归纳失败，提高模型的数学推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取网页半结构化数据时存在泛化能力差或资源消耗大（每页使用大语言模型推理）的问题。

Method: SCRIBES利用网站内网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，通过强化学习生成可应用于结构相似页面的抽取脚本，并在野外CommonCrawl数据上迭代训练提升效果。

Result: SCRIBES在脚本质量上较强基线提升13%以上，在使用GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%，实现了高效且可扩展的网页信息抽取。

Conclusion: 本方法显著提升了半结构化网页信息提取的效率和准确性，具备很强的资源节约和应用推广价值。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

TL;DR: 本论文针对视觉与语言模型参数庞大、训练数据量巨大的问题，提出了使用发展适宜的小规模多模态数据集训练的模型，性能优于先前基线。通过模型融合提升多模态模型在纯语言任务上的表现，同时保持多模态性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的视觉与语言模型依赖大量参数和海量数据，远超儿童语言习得时的语料量，存在资源使用不合理的问题。多模态模型在纯语言任务中表现欠佳，需要提升其语言能力。

Method: 在低资源环境下，使用发展适宜的数据集训练语言模型和多模态模型，采用模型融合（加权线性插值）方法融合多模态与纯语言模型参数以提升语言任务表现。

Result: 训练的多模态模型在BabyLM挑战基线模型上表现更优，但纯语言任务表现仍不足，通过模型融合方法提高了多模态模型在语言任务上的能力，同时不损害多模态性能。

Conclusion: 模型融合是提升多模态模型语言处理能力的有效途径，在保证多模态性能的前提下，缓解了多模态模型在纯语言任务中表现不足的问题。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

<details>

Motivation: 后训练大语言模型成本高，且频繁重新训练带来副作用，亟需一种精准且低成本的模型更新方法。

Method: REPAIR采用闭环反馈机制与动态内存管理，结合频繁知识融合和强局部保护，通过连续的渐进式适应性干预实现稳定的序列编辑。

Result: REPAIR在多个模型家族中提升了10%-30%的编辑准确率，显著降低了知识遗忘现象。

Conclusion: REPAIR为开发可靠、可扩展且持续进化的大语言模型提供了一个强健的终身编辑框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的防御机制零散且不完善，缺乏像分类器那样系统的对抗鲁棒性方法。

Method: 通过逆向语言建模（ILM）框架，实现同时提高模型对输入扰动的鲁棒性和通过反转模型输出检测不安全输入触发因素。

Result: ILM成功将大型语言模型从静态生成器转变为可分析且鲁棒的系统，有助于红队测试。

Conclusion: ILM为下一代更具鲁棒性、可控性和可信度的语言模型奠定基础。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有声明验证方法多依赖提示工程或预设计推理流程，缺乏统一训练范式提升模型检索与推理能力，难以适应真实动态的在线验证场景。

Method: 设计了Veri-R1框架，通过强化学习使大语言模型在与搜索引擎交互过程中接收奖励信号，驱动模型有效规划、检索和推理，实现动态信息交互和技能综合提升。

Result: 实验表明，Veri-R1在联合准确性上提升高达30%，证据评分翻倍，且常超过更大规模模型表现；消融实验分析了奖励组件和输出概率与标签准确率的关联。

Conclusion: 验证了在线强化学习在精准且可信声明验证中的有效性，为未来利用大语言模型改善声明验证提供了方法基础，并公开了代码促进社区研究。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体的价值观解读具有主观性，受社会文化背景影响，AI系统需理解个体价值观以避免偏见，促进多元视角的融合。

Method: 使用多维主观注释（情感、情绪、论点、主题）作为个体解读视角的代理，设计零样本和少样本设置，评估语言模型在预测个体价值观时的表现。

Result: 同时提供所有SEAT维度的信息优于只提供单一维度或无个体信息的基线模型；且注释者之间表现出明显个体差异，强调考虑个体主观注释者的重要性。

Conclusion: 首次在受控小规模实验中探讨注释行为对价值预测的影响，为未来大规模验证提供坚实基础，推动AI对多元个体价值观的理解和适应。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

### [72] [Exploring Database Normalization Effects on SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01989)
*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了数据库模式规范化对自然语言到SQL转换系统性能的影响，发现模式设计对不同类型查询的表现有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多在固定数据库模式上评估自然语言到SQL系统，忽视了模式设计特别是规范化程度对模型性能的影响。

Method: 作者构建了不同规范化级别（1NF-3NF）的合成数据集和实际学术论文数据集，评估了八种大型语言模型在不同模式下对查询的表现。

Result: 结果显示非规范化模式在简单查询中表现优异，而规范化模式在聚合查询上表现更好，且通过few-shot示例能缓解规范化带来的预测难题。

Conclusion: 模式设计对自然语言到SQL系统性能影响显著，应根据查询类型选择合适的规范化级别，建议在实际应用中集成自适应模式选择机制。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并比较了不同模型在低资源语言环境中的表现，强调了基于文化和语言特征的预训练的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线社交媒体中仇恨言论泛滥，尤其是低资源语言的检测系统匮乏，现有孟加拉语研究多为单任务、覆盖面有限，亟需多任务、多维度的仇恨言论检测资源和系统。

Method: 引入了首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，进行人工标注，涵盖类型、严重性和目标等多个维度；在该数据集上对经典基线模型、孟加拉语预训练模型和大型语言模型（LLMs）进行零样本提示和LoRA微调的系统比较。

Result: 实验表明，LoRA微调的大型语言模型表现具竞争力，但基于文化和语言背景的预训练模型仍表现出较为稳健的效果，体现预训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文的数据集和实验结果为低资源语言文化契合的社交媒体内容监管提供了更强的基准，有助于未来孟加拉语及类似语言的仇恨言论检测和治理工具开发。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型创造力主要关注输出质量，忽视了生成过程，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于叙事学理论，引入基于约束的决策机制，通过控制提示赋予作者角色，分析模型的创作偏好和决策理由。

Result: 发现大语言模型在创作中更重视风格（Style）元素，且不同模型表现出独特的创作侧重点。

Conclusion: 本文方法为系统分析AI创作过程提供了新工具，有助于深入理解大语言模型的作者性创造力。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Motivation: 传统语音对话系统存在幻觉和响应延迟问题，难以实现高准确率且自然的对话体验。现有文本系统通过工具集成缓解信息准确性问题，但语音系统中集成工具导致延迟增加，影响对话流畅性。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG通过并行预测工具调用，实现了低延迟高准确性语音对话生成，推动了实时性更强、智能化程度更高的AI助手发展。该方法具有广泛的模态适应能力，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SCoT，一种用于双工端到端语音对话系统的流式链式思维框架，解决了传统VAD和双工模型在响应生成和语义推理中的局限性，实现了更连贯、可解释且低延迟的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端语音对话系统依赖语音活动检测进行轮次切换，但无法区分暂停和轮次完成，且双工模型结构复杂且语义推理能力较弱。

Method: 提出基于固定时长用户输入和分块生成响应的流式链式思维框架，利用帧级对齐生成中间目标，实现用户转录和系统响应的块级匹配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比现有双工模型生成的响应更连贯且可解释，并在低延迟和重叠交互方面优于逐轮系统。

Conclusion: SCoT框架有效提升了双工语音对话系统的响应质量和交互效率，为端到端语音对话系统提供了新方案。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

TL;DR: 投机性解码通过一个较小的模型辅助推理，能加速大语言模型的解码过程，但不同任务的加速效果不均衡，特别是欠拟合和代表性不足的任务加速较少。本文分析了这种不公平现象的原因，并提出了相应的缓解策略，取得了12%的公平性提升。


<details>

Motivation: 投机性解码虽然能加速大语言模型的推理，但其加速效果在不同任务间出现明显差异，导致部分任务受益较少，存在公平性问题。

Method: 本研究通过理论分析量化了投机性解码加速率的差异，识别影响差异的因素，提出了一种缓解加速率不公平的策略，并在多个模型对上进行了验证。

Result: 提出的缓解方法在多组模型测试中实现了平均12%的公平性指标提升，表明该方法有效减少了不同任务间的加速率差异。

Conclusion: 投机性解码存在任务间的加速率不公平问题，针对这一问题的缓解策略能够有效提升不同任务的加速平衡性，促进解码效率的公平分配。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RESTRAIN的自我约束强化学习框架，通过利用未标记数据中的信息进行自我惩罚，提升大型推理模型的链式推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人类标注数据的强化学习方法在提升推理模型能力上成本高昂且难以应对更复杂的任务，因此需要探索无需标注数据的模型自我提升方法。

Method: RESTRAIN框架通过惩罚模型中对错误答案过于自信的推理过程和低一致性示例，利用模型整个答案分布的信息转化无金标数据为有效学习信号，并无缝集成到策略优化方法中实现无监督的持续自我改进。

Result: RESTRAIN在多个复杂推理基准测试中表现出显著提升，使用Qwen3-4B-Base和OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base模型，在AIME25、MMLU_STEM和GPQA-Diamond上分别实现了高达140.7%、36.2%和19.6%的Pass@1提升，接近有监督训练效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为大规模推理模型的无监督强化学习提供了有效路径，显著提升了推理能力，减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖，推动了更强推理模型的可扩展发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前幻觉检测大多视为二分类任务，而实际应用中需要识别具体的幻觉文本片段，属于多步骤决策过程，因此探索引入显式推理来提升检测准确性。

Method: 首先评估带Chain-of-Thought推理的预训练模型表现，发现多次采样可生成正确答案；基于此，提出基于强化学习的RL4HS框架，设计片段级奖励函数，利用Group Relative Policy Optimization和Class-Aware Policy Optimization解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准（摘要、问答、数据到文本）测试中，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调方法，验证了使用片段奖励的强化学习方法对于幻觉片段检测的有效性。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合片段级奖励机制能显著提升大语言模型中幻觉片段的检测效果，显式推理是解决此复杂多步决策任务的有效策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Motivation: 知识图谱查询门槛高，特别是SPARQL语言复杂，非计算机背景用户难以使用。Text2SPARQL挑战推动了相关领域的改进。

Method: 基于SPINACH，将自然语言问题转化为SPARQL查询，不是单次翻译，而是通过迭代的探索和执行过程完成。介绍了系统架构和设计思想，并深入分析了代理行为。

Conclusion: 通过迭代式LLM辅助翻译方法显著降低了知识图谱查询门槛，为后续优化和推广提供了理论及实践基础。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Conclusion: AMPO显示了多教师指导的灵活性和高效性，为提升大型语言模型的推理性能和泛化能力提供了可扩展且高效的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了InfoMosaic-Bench，一个专门针对多源信息获取的多工具辅助智能体的基准，展示了当前大型语言模型在结合通用搜索与领域特定工具时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，面临信息噪声和领域知识不足的问题，尽管MCP协议允许接入大量专用工具，但尚不清楚智能体是否能有效整合多源工具用于复杂任务。

Method: 设计InfoMosaic-Bench涵盖六个领域，利用InfoMosaic-Flow合成任务，保证任务基于已验证的工具输出，强调跨源依赖性并剔除简单可查解任务，保证任务的可靠性和复杂度。

Result: 基于14个先进LLM智能体的实验表明：（1）仅依赖网络信息准确率低（GPT-5准确率38.2%）；（2）领域工具带来有限且不稳定的收益；（3）22.4%的失败源于工具使用不当，显示当前LLM工具处理能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在多源信息整合和工具有效利用方面仍存在显著挑战，未来需加强工具选择及使用能力以提升复杂任务处理表现。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

*Wen Yang,Junhong Wu,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于强化学习后训练(RPT)的大型推理模型(LRMs)的跨语言推理能力，发现其跨语言迁移性能因模型基础、目标语言及训练范式而异，并揭示了单语表现与跨语言泛化之间的缺口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注推理模型在不同任务或模态间的泛化，本研究则首次从跨语言角度探讨RL推理能力的迁移效果，解决英文推理能力能否有效转移到其他语言的问题。

Method: 通过系统评估英文中心的LRMs在多语言推理基准上的表现，提出衡量跨语言迁移性的指标，开展干预研究分析模型对英语特定模式的依赖，进而设计平行训练实验验证跨语言迁移规律。

Result: 发现跨语言迁移性受初始模型、目标语言和训练范式显著影响；首次发现"第一平行飞跃"现象和"平行扩展法则"，即迁移性能随平行语言数量呈幂律增长；同时揭示了"单语泛化差距"，说明英文中心模型难以完全跨语言泛化。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LRMs推理能力与人类认知相似的假设，强调构建语言无关的推理模型的重要性，对未来跨语言推理模型的设计提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Method: 设计了一个基于YAML配置的统一接口，支持对16个主流VLM及30多变体的中间输出提取，并易于集成多种解释性分析方法。

Result: 通过两个简单的分析实验，揭示了不同VLM在不同层和目标概念上的隐藏表示存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: VLM-Lens作为开源工具发布，可加速社区对视觉语言模型的理解和改进。

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that
abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation
across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

Motivation: 现有顶尖嵌入模型通常依赖复杂的对比预训练、昂贵的合成训练数据和复杂的训练流程，训练成本高且难以复现。

Method: 从基础模型出发，利用600万条开源、非合成的查询-文档-负样本三元组直接微调，简化训练流程且控制成本。

Result: 在MTEB英语排行榜中，F2LLM-4B在约4B参数模型中排名第二，整体排名第七；F2LLM-1.7B在1B-2B参数范围内排名第一。

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑传统的两玩家对战模型中平局意味着两模型实力相等的假设，发现忽略平局评分更新能提高评分系统预测准确性，并建议未来评分系统应考虑查询难度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Elo的评分系统将平局视为两模型实力相等，可能忽略了平局背后与查询难度相关的重要信息。

Method: 分析三个真实竞技场数据集，比较不同评分系统在忽略平局评分调整与考虑平局评分调整情况下的预测准确性，并探讨平局出现与查询难度和客观性之间的关系。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使预测准确率提升1-3%，且平局更频繁出现在难度极易和高度客观的查询中。

Conclusion: 现有评分系统的平局语义需重新考虑，应结合查询属性调整评分更新策略以提升模型评分准确性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多阶段、多模型协同的代码生成框架PerfOrch，通过动态选择最适合的LLM模型完成代码生成与优化，显著提升了代码正确率和运行性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单一模型在不同编程语言和任务上的表现差异较大，忽略了多模型组合的潜力，影响代码生成质量和效率。

Method: 基于17个前沿LLM在多语言和多指标上的系统评测，设计了一个分阶段（生成-修复-优化）动态调度机制，使用性能指导的验证与回滚策略，将任务分配给最合适的模型。

Result: PerfOrch在HumanEval-X和EffiBench-X数据集上正确率分别达到96.22%和91.37%，显著超过GPT-4o的78.66%和49.11%；同时在多语言上运行时间得到了17.67%-27.66%的加速提升。

Conclusion: 通过多模型性能导向的协同调度，PerfOrch实现了代码生成的质量和效率双重提升，且架构具备良好扩展性，适应AI生成领域的快速发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for
automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore
the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across
programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper
challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage,
performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks
to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our
approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art
LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using
HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness
and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization,
and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language,
development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we
present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each
task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without
requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over
strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37%
on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and
49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance
optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median
speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The
framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing
new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm
for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly
evolving generative AI landscape.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了GitHub开源项目中“wontfix”标签的使用情况及其背后的原因，发现约30%的项目会对某些问题使用该标签，原因涵盖用户和维护者多方面因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: "wontfix"标签广泛使用但理解有限，且其对项目管理和社区动态的影响不明确，亟需深入研究。

Method: 采用混合方法，收集了3132个流行GitHub仓库的定量数据分析标签使用频率，并通过开放式编码和主题分析定性理解使用原因。

Result: 约30%的项目使用了"wontfix"标签，主要用于用户提交的错误报告和功能请求，归纳出八大主题解释标签背后的原因。

Conclusion: "wontfix"标签在资源管理和引导贡献者方面起重要作用，但也可能抑制社区参与和降低项目管理透明度，理解原因有助于项目管理和社区合作。

Abstract: Context: The ``wontfix'' label is a widely used yet narrowly understood tool
in GitHub repositories, indicating that an issue will not be pursued further.
Despite its prevalence, the impact of this label on project management and
community dynamics within open-source software development is not clearly
defined. Objective: This study examines the prevalence and reasons behind
issues being labeled as wontfix across various open-source repositories on
GitHub. Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, we analyze both quantitative
data to assess the prevalence of the wontfix label and qualitative data to
explore the reasoning that it was used. Data were collected from 3,132 of
GitHub's most-popular repositories. Later, we employ open coding and thematic
analysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a
structured understanding of the issue management landscape. Results: Our
findings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the wontfix label to
some issues. These issues most often occur on user-submitted issues for bug
reports and feature requests. The study identified eight common themes behind
labeling issues as wontfix, ranging from user-specific control factors to
maintainer-specific decisions. Conclusions: The wontfix label is a critical
tool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects.
However, it can also discourage community involvement and obscure the
transparency of project management. Understanding these reasons aids project
managers in making informed decisions and fostering efficient collaboration
within open-source communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子游戏的复杂性和多样化策略使传统自动化测试算法难以全面覆盖，现有基于强化学习、模仿学习或大语言模型的游戏代理忽视了玩家多变个性，导致测试策略单一，难以发现边缘情况。

Method: 提出MIMIC框架，将多样化人格特质集成入游戏代理，使代理能在相似情境下采用不同游戏策略，模仿多样化玩法，从而增强测试覆盖和游戏互动丰富性。

Result: MIMIC在不同游戏中达成了更高的测试覆盖率和更丰富的游戏内交互，在Minecraft中以更高任务完成率和更多多样解决方案优于现有最先进代理。

Conclusion: MIMIC显著提升了游戏测试的有效性，证明了引入多样化人格特质以模拟多元游戏策略在提升自动测试质量方面的潜力。

Abstract: Modern video games pose significant challenges for traditional automated
testing algorithms, yet intensive testing is crucial to ensure game quality. To
address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using
Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However,
these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due
to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar
situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle
to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases.
  In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse
personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming
strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can
achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different
games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a
higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results
highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.

Motivation: 自动生成模糊测试驱动虽能节省成本和专业知识需求，但产生了大量误报崩溃，降低了系统和维护团队的信任度。

Method: 采用约束驱动生成方法，在驱动创建时主动施加输入和状态约束；通过基于上下文的崩溃验证，反向分析函数调用者来判断崩溃是否合理。

Conclusion: 集成AI技术于大规模模糊测试流程具有巨大潜力，但仍面临挑战；本文方法有效提升了自动模糊驱动生成的质量和信赖度。

Abstract: Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs
and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and
open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,
which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target
function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz
drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models
to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers
frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly
structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially
crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as
reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system
and the team.
  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in
OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,
constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a
function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based
crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether
reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark
functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes
by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that
frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results
highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing
pipelines.

Conclusion: 结合区块链的许可证管理平台能够有效促进开源软件许可证的兼容性与合规性，具有推广应用价值。

Abstract: Open Source Software (OSS) is widely used and carries licenses that indicate
the terms under which the software is provided for use, also specifying
modification and distribution rules. Ensuring that users are respecting OSS
license terms when creating derivative works is a complex process. Compliance
issues arising from incompatibilities among licenses may lead to legal
disputes. At the same time, the blockchain technology with immutable entries
offers a mechanism to provide transparency when it comes to licensing and
ensure software changes are recorded. In this work, we are introducing an
integration of blockchain and license management when creating derivative
works, in order to tackle the issue of OSS license compatibility. We have
designed, implemented and performed a preliminary evaluation of FOSS-chain, a
web platform that uses blockchain and automates the license compliance process,
covering 14 OSS licenses. We have evaluated the initial prototype version of
the FOSS-chain platform via a small scale user study. Our preliminary results
are promising, demonstrating the potential of the platform for adaptation on
realistic software systems.

Motivation: 当前基于硬件的安卓应用能耗测量流程复杂、耗时，缺乏便捷且开源的工具，限制了开发者和研究人员的使用。

Method: 提出并实现了ARENA插件，能够在IDE中连接物理能耗测量设备，执行测试场景并自动采集、聚合、分析能耗数据，同时提供统计和可视化功能。

Result: ARENA成功集成于IntelliJ和Android Studio，支持开发者比较不同应用或不同版本的能耗，简化了硬件测量流程。

Conclusion: ARENA为安卓应用开发者提供了一个高效、易用的硬件能耗测量解决方案，促进能效优化与研究。

Abstract: To build energy-efficient apps, there is a need to estimate and analyze their
energy consumption in typical usage scenarios. The energy consumption of
Android apps could be estimated via software-based and hardware-based
approaches. Software-based approaches, while easier to implement, are not as
accurate as hardware-based approaches. The process of measuring the energy
consumption of an Android app via a hardware-based approach typically involves
1) setting up a measurement environment, 2) executing the app under test on a
mobile device, 3) recording current/voltage data via a hardware device to
measure energy consumption, and 4) cleaning and aggregating data for analyses,
reports, and visualizations. Specialized scripts are written for selected
hardware and software components to ensure reliable energy measurements. The
energy measurement process is repeated many times and aggregated to remove
noise. These steps make the hardware-based energy measurement process
time-consuming and not easy to adapt or reproduce. There is a lack of
open-source tools available for developers and researchers to take reliable
energy measurements via hardware devices. In this paper, we present and
demonstrate ARENA, a support tool that enables developers and researchers to
connect to a physical measurement device without leaving the comfort of their
IDE. Developers could use ARENA during development to compare energy
consumption between different apps or versions of the same app. ARENA
calculates energy consumption on an Android smartphone by executing a test
scenario on the app under development. Further, ARENA helps aggregate,
statistically analyze, report, and visualize the data, allowing developers and
researchers to dig into the data directly or visually. We implemented ARENA as
an IntelliJ and Android Studio plugin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于非自回归(NAR)的自动程序修复模型NARRepair，以提高修复速度并保证修复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归(AR)的自动程序修复方法虽然效果较好，但存在时间延迟严重的问题，尤其在大模型参数下更加明显。

Method: NARRepair模型结合修复动作预测器、词间依赖提取器和两阶段解码器三大创新，以缓解NAR方法在修复任务中存在的过度修正、缺乏词间依赖和上下文信息不足等问题。

Result: NARRepair在三个主流数据集上均表现出优异性能，在有限修复时间内效果最好，且修复速度相比AR技术在GPU环境中提升了1.4-6.4倍。

Conclusion: NARRepair实现了自动程序修复任务中修复速度和准确率的综合领先，展示了非自回归方法在APR中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various
application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on
automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous
machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the
autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.
Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has
a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large
number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the
non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code
in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the
NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch
quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper
propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR
task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the
repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the
inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking
inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for
alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair
on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that
1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best
performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR
techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times
in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved
state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and
accuracy.

*Victor Lira,Paulo Borba,Rodrigo Bonifácio,Galileu Santos e Matheus barbosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了RefFilter，一种基于重构识别的语义干扰检测工具，用以减少协同软件开发中的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义干扰检测技术虽然高效，但无法区分行为保持的代码重构与真正影响行为的更改，导致较高误报。

Method: RefFilter结合自动重构检测技术，对现有静态分析方法进行改进，剔除行为保持的重构，从而减少误报。

Result: 实验在两个数据集中进行，RefFilter在带标签数据集上将误报率降低了近32%，仅轻微增加少量漏报。

Conclusion: 引入重构识别的语义干扰检测显著提升了精度，是提升现代开发合并支持的实用有效策略。

Abstract: Detecting semantic interference remains a challenge in collaborative software
development. Recent lightweight static analysis techniques improve efficiency
over SDG-based methods, but they still suffer from a high rate of false
positives. A key cause of these false positives is the presence of
behavior-preserving code refactorings, which current techniques cannot
effectively distinguish from changes that impact behavior and can interfere
with others. To handle this problem we present RefFilter, a refactoring-aware
tool for semantic interference detection. It builds on existing static
techniques by incorporating automated refactoring detection to improve
precision. RefFilter discards behavior-preserving refactorings from reports,
reducing false positives while preserving detection coverage. To evaluate
effectiveness and scalability, use two datasets: a labeled dataset with 99
scenarios and ground truth, and a novel dataset of 1,087 diverse merge
scenarios that we have built. Experimental results show that RefFilter reduces
false positives by nearly 32% on the labeled dataset. While this reduction
comes with a non significant increase in false negatives, the overall gain in
precision significantly outweighs the minor trade-off in recall. These findings
demonstrate that refactoring-aware interference detection is a practical and
effective strategy for improving merge support in modern development workflows.

### [99] [Clarifying Semantics of In-Context Examples for Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01994)
*Chen Yang,Lin Yang,Ziqi Wang,Dong Wang,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLAST，一种通过程序分析和大语言模型重写相结合的方法，系统性地提升单元测试的语义清晰度，从而作为上下文示例提升测试生成效果，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在单元测试生成中受到示例质量影响，语义不清晰的测试示例导致生成效果不佳，亟需提升测试示例的语义清晰性以提高生成效果。

Method: CLAST通过将复杂测试分解为逻辑更清晰的单元测试，结合程序分析和基于大语言模型的重写技术，系统优化单元测试的语义清晰度。

Result: 在多个项目上，CLAST相较于现有UTgen技术保持了测试的有效性（如编译成功率、通过率、覆盖率和变异分数），用户研究中有超过85%的参与者更偏好CLAST处理后的测试，且CLAST优化案例显著提升了基于ICL的测试生成性能。

Conclusion: CLAST有效提升单元测试的语义清晰度和生成测试的质量，展示了其在软件测试实践中的潜力，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising
performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However,
the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness
of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples
often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel
technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic
clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach
decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic
clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We
evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results
demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art
refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing
semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness
of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate
(PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%,
35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user
study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably,
incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based
unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an
average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for
generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights
from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in
software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.

*Maximilian Kratz,Steffen Zschaler,Jens Kosiol,Gabriele Taentzer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文探讨了优化问题在情境变化时的再优化问题，提出利用模型驱动工程方法系统地从原始优化问题推导再优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决再优化过程中需要最小化原方案更改、部分方案不可变更及生成修改脚本的挑战。

Method: 采用模型驱动工程中的声明式建模语言和模型变换，实现再优化问题的自动衍生；并基于GIPS工具进行概念验证，应用于助教分配问题。

Result: 提供了组合再优化问题的分类、推导策略及初步实现，验证了该方法在资源分配场景中的可行性。

Conclusion: 模型驱动工程为再优化问题提供了系统建模与自动推导的新途径，提升了适应情境变化时优化方案调整的效率和规范性。

Abstract: Once an optimisation problem has been solved, the solution may need
adaptation when contextual factors change. This challenge, also known as
reoptimisation, has been addressed in various problem domains, such as railway
crew rescheduling, nurse rerostering, or aircraft recovery. This requires a
modified problem to be solved again to ensure that the adapted solution is
optimal in the new context. However, the new optimisation problem differs
notably from the original problem: (i) we want to make only minimal changes to
the original solution to minimise the impact; (ii) we may be unable to change
some parts of the original solution (e.g., because they refer to past
allocations); and (iii) we need to derive a change script from the original
solution to the new solution. In this paper, we argue that Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) - in particular, the use of declarative modelling languages
and model transformations for the high-level specification of optimisation
problems - offers new opportunities for the systematic derivation of
reoptimisation problems from the original optimisation problem specification.
We focus on combinatorial reoptimisation problems and provide an initial
categorisation of changing problems and strategies for deriving the
corresponding reoptimisation specifications. We introduce an initial
proof-of-concept implementation based on the GIPS (Graph-Based (Mixed) Integer
Linear Programming Problem Specification) tool and apply it to an example
resource-allocation problem: the allocation of teaching assistants to teaching
sessions.

### [101] [ACM SIGSOFT SEN Empirical Software Engineering: Introducing Our New Regular Column](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02007)
*Justus Bogner,Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) has matured but still faces challenges like reproducibility and practical application. The new SEN-ESE column aims to discuss meta-aspects and encourage community engagement to improve ESE research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESE faces ongoing challenges such as research reproducibility, limited external validity, subjective reviews, and difficulties in applying research practically. Moreover, many aspects of ESE are not explicitly documented, making it harder for newcomers.

Method: Introduction of a new regular ACM SIGSOFT SEN column (SEN-ESE) focused on discussing meta-aspects of ESE research through expert interviews, focus groups, surveys, and position pieces.

Result: The column provides a platform for reflection, discussion, and improvement of ESE research practices, communication, teaching, and application, encouraging community feedback and contributions.

Conclusion: SEN-ESE aims to foster ongoing dialogue and improvement in ESE research, shaped by community interests and contributions, to address underexplored and challenging topics.

Abstract: From its early foundations in the 1970s, empirical software engineering (ESE)
has evolved into a mature research discipline that embraces a plethora of
different topics, methodologies, and industrial practices. Despite its
remarkable progress, the ESE research field still needs to keep evolving, as
new impediments, shortcoming, and technologies emerge. Research
reproducibility, limited external validity, subjectivity of reviews, and
porting research results to industrial practices are just some examples of the
drivers for improvements to ESE research. Additionally, several facets of ESE
research are not documented very explicitly, which makes it difficult for
newcomers to pick them up. With this new regular ACM SIGSOFT SEN column
(SEN-ESE), we introduce a venue for discussing meta-aspects of ESE research,
ranging from general topics such as the nature and best practices for
replication packages, to more nuanced themes such as statistical methods,
interview transcription tools, and publishing interdisciplinary research. Our
aim for the column is to be a place where we can regularly spark conversations
on ESE topics that might not often be touched upon or are left implicit.
Contributions to this column will be grounded in expert interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and position pieces, with the goal of encouraging reflection
and improvement in how we conduct, communicate, teach, and ultimately improve
ESE research. Finally, we invite feedback from the ESE community on
challenging, controversial, or underexplored topics, as well as suggestions for
voices you would like to hear from. While we cannot promise to act on every
idea, we aim to shape this column around the community interests and are
grateful for all contributions.

*Peter Wauyo,Dalia Bwiza,Alain Murara,Edwin Mugume,Eric Umuhoza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态系统，结合视频和音频数据，通过张量融合网络检测公共交通中的欺诈和逃票行为，准确率达到89.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共交通中的欺诈和逃票行为严重影响运营收益和安全，现有检测技术准确率和召回率较低，亟需高效且实时的解决方案。

Method: 利用ViViT模型提取视频特征，AST模型分析音频特征，采用张量融合网络（TFN）实现视频与音频的复杂交互融合，提高多模态信息的利用效率。

Result: 系统在自定义数据集上实现了89.5%的准确率、87.2%的精确率和84.0%的召回率，较传统早期融合方法分别提升了7.0% F1值和8.8%召回率，且优于现有75%召回率的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态融合系统能够实时检测交通欺诈，提高检测效果，帮助公共交通运营商减少损失、提升安全及合规性。

Abstract: This research introduces a multimodal system designed to detect fraud and
fare evasion in public transportation by analyzing closed circuit television
(CCTV) and audio data. The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for
Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram
Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion
Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal
interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique
captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g.,
tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds).
The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of
89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent
activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding
the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation
fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor
fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost
in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports
real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue
loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.

*Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji,El-hacen Diallo,Jordan Samhi,Kui Liu,Jacques Klein,Tegawendé F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了SIEVE框架，为代码数据集提供可验证的质量保证，取代传统的不可审计的静态“数据集卡”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共代码数据集缺乏可验证的质量保证，静态“数据集卡”无法审计且无统计保证，导致质量难以保证且清洗流程分散且成本高。

Method: 提出SIEVE，一个社区驱动框架，将每项属性检查转化为可机器读取、可验证且具有随时有效统计边界的信任证书“信用卡”。

Result: SIEVE能够替代传统叙述式数据集卡，实现数据集质量的随时可验证认证，增强了信任度并降低了质量保证成本。

Conclusion: 通过推广SIEVE，期望实现数据集质量认证的标准化与自动化，提高代码数据集的质量保障效率与可信度。

Abstract: Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets,
yet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards'
inform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical
guarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build
isolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We
present SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into
Confidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid
statistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity,
replacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is
expected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.

*Vadim Safronov,Anthony McCaigue,Nicholas Allott,Andrew Martin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向AI系统的可信软件物料清单框架（TAIBOM），以解决当前SBOM在AI组件动态性和数据驱动特性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的复杂性和动态性使得传统软件依赖管理和系统保障方法无法满足需求，且现有SBOM框架无法有效捕捉AI系统的特性，缺乏完整的完整性、信任及合规性保障工具。

Method: 提出TAIBOM框架，设计专门针对AI组件的结构化依赖模型；实现跨异构AI流水线的完整性声明传播机制；引入信任证明过程以验证组件来源。

Result: TAIBOM能够支持AI工作流的保障、安全和合规，明显优于现有SBOM标准如SPDX和CycloneDX，增强了AI系统的透明度和可验证性。

Conclusion: TAIBOM为构建可信赖、可验证的AI系统奠定基础，通过结构化的软件透明度提升AI系统的信任和合规水平。

Abstract: The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies
has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain,
challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance.
While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing
transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the
unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven
nature and the loosely coupled dependencies across datasets, models, and
software components. These challenges are compounded by fragmented governance
structures and the lack of robust tools for ensuring integrity, trust, and
compliance in AI-enabled environments.
  In this paper, we introduce Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) -- a novel
framework extending SBOM principles to the AI domain. TAIBOM provides (i) a
structured dependency model tailored for AI components, (ii) mechanisms for
propagating integrity statements across heterogeneous AI pipelines, and (iii) a
trust attestation process for verifying component provenance. We demonstrate
how TAIBOM supports assurance, security, and compliance across AI workflows,
highlighting its advantages over existing standards such as SPDX and CycloneDX.
This work lays the foundation for trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through
structured software transparency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于黑板架构的新型多智能体通信范式，用于解决大规模异构数据湖中数据发现的难题，显著提升了任务成功率和数据发现的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体和主从多智能体系统难以有效应对大规模异构数据湖中的数据发现问题，且主从模式依赖中央控制器对各子智能体能力的预先了解，限制了系统的扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 提出一种灵感来源于传统AI黑板架构的多智能体通信框架，中央智能体在共享黑板上发布请求，分布式子智能体自主响应，基于其能力志愿处理任务，避免对中央协调器的依赖。

Result: 在三个基准测试（KramaBench、改进后的DS-Bench和DA-Code）中，所提黑板架构方法相较于RAG及主从多智能体范式，实现了端到端任务成功率提升13%至57%和数据发现F1分数提升最高9%的显著进步。

Conclusion: 黑板架构为多智能体系统提供了一种可扩展、通用的通信框架，有效提升了大规模数据湖中数据发现的性能，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

*Yeqi Feng,Yucheng Lu,Hongyu Su,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: SimCity是一个利用大语言模型构建的多智能体宏观经济模拟框架，能够自然语言解释经济行为并模拟多市场交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统宏观经济模型在处理异质性时受限，要么简化代理多样性，要么依赖固定规则，难以捕捉复杂真实行为。利用LLM能实现更加灵活和透明的经济行为建模。

Method: 设计四类核心代理（家庭、企业、中央银行、政府），通过LLM模拟劳动、商品和金融市场的互动。引入视觉语言模型确定企业地理分布并生成虚拟城市地图，实现宏观经济与城市扩展的联合模拟。

Result: SimCity成功重现了多项经典宏观经济现象如需求价格弹性、恩格尔定律、奥肯定律、菲利普斯曲线和贝弗里奇曲线，且模拟结果在多次运行中具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与多智能体体系，SimCity为宏观经济建模提供一种兼具解释性与灵活性的创新方法，拓展了研究宏观经济和城市发展动态的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing
realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a
multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable
macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike
classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or
traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules,
SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language
reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central
bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor
market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms
and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic
regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To
evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic
phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the
Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally
reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation
runs.
