We\nsystematically evaluate embedding-based retrieval, prompt-based listwise\nranking, and hybrid approaches, revealing that method effectiveness depends\nheavily on domain-specific factors rather than inherent algorithmic\nsuperiority. Through empirical investigation on enterprise-derived benchmarks,\nwe find that embedding-based methods offer superior latency for large tool\nrepositories, while listwise ranking provides better disambiguation for\noverlapping functionalities, with hybrid approaches showing promise in specific\ncontexts.

However,\nsuch workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct\noutput at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages,\ncompounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over\nnon-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the\nMonte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware\nverification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic\nworkflows."}

Methods as main\nbuilding blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for\ncode comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be\nchallenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We\npropose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists\ndevelopers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin\nacts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is\naugmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the\nend-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the\ncomment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a\ncall graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search\n(DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompts.

We investigate why iteratively-paraphrased text -- itself AI-generated\n-- evades detection systems designed for AIGT identification. Through intrinsic\nmechanism analysis, we reveal that iterative paraphrasing creates an\nintermediate laundering region characterized by semantic displacement with\npreserved generation patterns, which brings up two attack categories:\nparaphrasing human-authored text (authorship obfuscation) and paraphrasing\nLLM-generated text (plagiarism evasion). To address these vulnerabilities, we\nintroduce PADBen, the first benchmark systematically evaluating detector\nrobustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. PADBen comprises a\nfive-type text taxonomy capturing the full trajectory from original content to\ndeeply laundered text, and five progressive detection tasks across\nsentence-pair and single-sentence challenges. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art\ndetectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the\nplagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation.

We focus on prominent architectures such\nas BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to examine their vulnerability to\ngender bias. To quantify the degree of bias, we introduce a novel metric,\nMALoR, which assesses bias based on model probabilities for filling masked\ntokens. We further propose a mitigation approach involving continued\npre-training on a gender-balanced dataset generated via Counterfactual Data\nAugmentation. Our experiments reveal significant reductions in gender bias\nscores across different pronoun pairs.

Code at: https://github.com/EshaanT/XNationQA", "summary": "Most multilingual question-answering benchmarks, while covering a diverse\npool of languages, do not factor in regional diversity in the information they\ncapture and tend to be Western-centric. This introduces a significant gap in\nfairly evaluating multilingual models' comprehension of factual information\nfrom diverse geographical locations. To address this, we introduce XNationQA\nfor investigating the cultural literacy of multilingual LLMs. XNationQA\nencompasses a total of 49,280 questions on the geography, culture, and history\nof nine countries, presented in seven languages. We benchmark eight standard\nmultilingual LLMs on XNationQA and evaluate them using two novel transference\nmetrics. Our analyses uncover a considerable discrepancy in the models'\naccessibility to culturally specific facts across languages. Notably, we often\nfind that a model demonstrates greater knowledge of cultural information in\nEnglish than in the dominant language of the respective culture. The models\nexhibit better performance in Western languages, although this does not\nnecessarily translate to being more literate for Western countries, which is\ncounterintuitive. Furthermore, we observe that models have a very limited\nability to transfer knowledge across languages, particularly evident in\nopen-source models."}

However, existing evaluation models for\ninstruction following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial\ncosts and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM\ncritic that can provide efficient and reliable assessments of constraint\nfollowing in the instructions.

With the assistance\nof the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a\nmulti-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level\npreference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong\nLLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini.

We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack,\nwhich employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which\noptimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize\nits effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently\ninducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers.\nFurthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To\ncounter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense. While it\nsubstantially reduces the attack success rate, we demonstrate that an adaptive\nattacker can partially circumvent this defense. Our findings underscore the\nneed for greater attention and rigorous safeguards against prompt-injection\nthreats in AI-assisted peer review."}

This\nproject proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by\nnative Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language\nmodels (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior.
