For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86R-MUSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7b54\u6848\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RMLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u673a\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6761\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RMLLMU-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86R-MUSE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u65e2\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cR-MUSE\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "R-MUSE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RMLLMU-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism.

Since too much congestion of pedestrian flows can cause serious accidents, mathematically modeling and predicting pedestrian behaviors is important for preventing such accidents and providing a safe and comfortable environment. Although numerous studies have investigated learning-based modeling methods, most of them focus only on the local behavior of pedestrians, such as collision avoidance with neighbors and environmental objects. In an actual environment, pedestrian behavior involves more complicated decision making including global route selection. Moreover, a state transition from stopping to walking at a traffic light should be considered simultaneously. In this study, the proposed model integrates local behaviors with global route selection, using an Attention mechanism to ensure consistent global and local behavior predictions. We recorded video data of pedestrians at Shibuya scramble crossing and trained the proposed model using pedestrian walking trajectory data obtained from the video.

We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline.

We evaluate two families of approaches for ticket prioritization: embedding-based pipelines that combine dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classical classifiers, and a fine-tuned multilingual transformer that processes both textual and numerical features. Embedding-based methods exhibit limited generalization across a wide range of thirty configurations, with clustering failing to uncover meaningful structures and supervised models highly sensitive to embedding quality. In contrast, the proposed transformer model achieves substantially higher performance, with an average F1-score of 78.5% and weighted Cohen's kappa values of nearly 0.80, indicating strong alignment with true labels. These results highlight the limitations of generic embeddings for ITSM data and demonstrate the effectiveness of domain-adapted transformer architectures for operational ticket prioritization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u5728IT\u670d\u52a1\u5de5\u5355\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8005\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eITSM\u670d\u52a1\u5de5\u5355\u6587\u672c\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u53ca\u7c7b\u522b\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u964d\u7ef4+\u805a\u7c7b+\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9IT\u670d\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406(ITSM)\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5de5\u5355\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5fae\u8c03Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u805a\u7c7b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u523078.5%\uff0c\u52a0\u6743Cohen's kappa\u8fd10.80\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ITSM\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5de5\u5355\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ITSM\u5de5\u5355\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional KV cache compression methods typically involve permanently evicting or irreversibly merging \"less important\" tokens with low attention scores. This approach results in the unrecoverable loss of token information, which we call Contextual Amnesia, significantly degrading the model's information retrieval capability. To address this issue, we propose KVReviver, a reversible KV cache compression method based on the sketch algorithm. This method allows reconstructing compressed tokens from an additional data structure, thus enabling full-scale computation within limited memory. Experiments showed that in 2k-length contexts, it requires only 10% of KV Cache budget while maintaining identical end-to-end inference accuracy.

However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance.

While classical software engineering has developed a rich body of dynamic and static techniques to study flakiness, corresponding evidence for quantum software remains limited. Prior work relies primarily on static analysis or small sets of manually reported incidents, leaving open questions about the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests.\n  This paper presents the first large-scale dynamic characterization of flaky tests in quantum software. We executed the Qiskit Terra test suite 10,000 times across 23 releases in controlled environments. For each release, we measured test-outcome variability, identified flaky tests, estimated empirical failure probabilities, analyzed recurrence across versions, and used Wilson confidence intervals to quantify rerun budgets for reliable detection. We further mapped flaky tests to Terra subcomponents to assess component-level susceptibility.\n  Across 27,026 test cases, we identified 290 distinct flaky tests. Although overall flakiness rates were low (0-0.4%), flakiness was highly episodic: nearly two-thirds of flaky tests appeared in only one release, while a small subset recurred intermittently or persistently. Many flaky tests failed with very small empirical probabilities ($\\hat{p} \\approx 10^{-4}$), implying that tens of thousands of executions may be required for confident detection. Flakiness was unevenly distributed across subcomponents, with 'transpiler' and 'quantum_info' accounting for the largest share.\n  These results show that quantum test flakiness is rare but difficult to detect under typical continuous integration budgets. To support future research, we release a public dataset of per-test execution outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u52a9\u529b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08flaky tests\uff09\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9Qiskit Terra\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u768423\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u6267\u884c\u4e8610000\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7248\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Wilson\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8dd1\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u572827026\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0290\u4e2a\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6613\u53d8\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff080-0.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ea\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7248\u672c\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u95f4\u6b47\u6216\u6301\u7eed\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728'transpiler'\u548c'quantum_info'\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6613\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e38\u89c4\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We introduce the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT), a benchmark that independently measures constraint compliance (CC) and semantic accuracy (SA) across compression levels. We evaluate 9 frontier LLMs across 8 concepts using 5 compression levels from extreme (c=0.0, ~2 words) to none (c=1.0, ~135 words). A three-judge LLM jury achieves almost perfect inter-rater agreement on CC (Fleiss' \\k{appa}=0.90).\n  We observe a universal U-curve pattern in constraint compliance (97.2% prevalence), with violations peaking at medium compression (c=0.5, ~27 words). Counterintuitively, models perform better at extreme compression than medium lengths. The dimensions are statistically orthogonal (r=0.193, p=0.084), with constraint effects 2.9x larger than semantic effects.\n  Experimental validation via RLHF ablation confirms our constraint salience hypothesis: removing \"helpfulness\" signals improves CC by 598% on average (71/72 trials, p<0.001), with 79% achieving perfect compliance. This demonstrates that RLHF-trained helpfulness behaviors are the dominant cause of constraint violations at medium compression. Reasoning models outperform efficient models by 27.5% (Cohen's d=0.96).\n  Our findings reveal a fundamental tension between RLHF alignment and instruction-following, providing actionable guidelines for improving deployed systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5185\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e2e\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5b88\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u8870\u51cf\u7406\u89e3\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08CDCT\uff09\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u5ea6\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u5bf99\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57285\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u30018\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664 RLHF \u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u5ea6\u968f\u538b\u7f29\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5448U\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u8fdd\u89c4\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5e2e\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u4e3b\u56e0\uff1b\u53bb\u9664\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\uff08\u63d0\u5347598%\uff09\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7adf\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u7684U\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to $17.06\\%$; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5143\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6MemEvolve\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MemEvolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5143\u8fdb\u5316\uff1b\u6784\u5efaEvolveLab\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faMemEvolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5143\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7EvolveLab\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MemEvolve\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Coverage-guided fuzzers waste effort on low-risk inputs, often ignoring vulnerability-triggering ones that do not increase coverage. Existing heuristics proposed to mitigate this require expert effort, are brittle, and hard to adapt.\n  Objective: We propose a data-centric, LLM-boosted alternative that learns from historical vulnerabilities to automatically identify minimal static (code) and dynamic (runtime) features for detecting high-risk inputs.\n  Method: Guided by historical V8 bugs, iterative prompting generated 115 static and 49 dynamic features, with the latter requiring only five trace flags, minimizing instrumentation cost. After feature selection, 41 features remained to train an XGBoost model to predict high-risk inputs during fuzzing.\n  Results: Combining static and dynamic features yields over 85% precision and under 1% false alarms. Only 25% of these features are needed for comparable performance, showing that most of the search space is irrelevant.\n  Conclusion: This work introduces feature-guided fuzzing, an automated data-driven approach that replaces coverage with data-directed inference, guiding fuzzers toward high-risk states for faster, targeted, and reproducible vulnerability discovery.

We introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Legal Reasoning (ReGal), a framework that integrates Multi-Task Instruction Tuning with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our approach is evaluated across two critical legal tasks: (i) Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE), and (ii) Legal Document Summarization. Although the framework underperforms on standard evaluation metrics compared to supervised and proprietary models, it provides valuable insights into the challenges of applying RL to legal texts. These challenges include reward model alignment, legal language complexity, and domain-specific adaptation. Through empirical and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how RL can be repurposed for high-stakes, long-document tasks in law.

Cortes", "Sandro J. Rigo", "Gabriel de O. Ramos"], "title": "Narrative Consolidation: Formulating a New Task for Unifying Multi-Perspective Accounts", "comment": null, "summary": "Processing overlapping narrative documents, such as legal testimonies or historical accounts, often aims not for compression but for a unified, coherent, and chronologically sound text. Standard Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), with its focus on conciseness, fails to preserve narrative flow. This paper formally defines this challenge as a new NLP task: Narrative Consolidation, where the central objectives are chronological integrity, completeness, and the fusion of complementary details. To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1). The success of this baseline method validates the formulation of Narrative Consolidation as a relevant task and establishes that an explicit temporal backbone is a fundamental component for its resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\u786e\u4fdd\u6587\u6863\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u6ce8\u91cd\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\uff08TAEG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u6838\u5fc3\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u2014\u2014\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4e14\u5185\u5bb9\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\uff08TAEG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u6838\u5fc3\u7248\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u90e8\u300a\u5723\u7ecf\u798f\u97f3\u4e66\u300b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6392\u5e8f\uff08Kendall's Tau 1.000\uff09\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u6307\u6807\uff08ROUGE-L F1\u63d0\u5347357.2%\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Hence, conducting thorough testing before deployment becomes imperative to ensure the reliability of GNNs. However, thorough testing requires numerous manually annotated test data. To mitigate the annotation cost, strategically prioritizing and labeling high-quality unlabeled inputs for testing becomes crucial, which facilitates uncovering more model failures with a limited labeling budget. Unfortunately, existing test input prioritization techniques either overlook the valuable information contained in graph structures or are overly reliant on attributes extracted from the target model, i.e., model-aware attributes, whose quality can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose a novel test input prioritization framework, named GraphRank, for GNNs. GraphRank introduces model-agnostic attributes to compensate for the limitations of the model-aware ones. It also leverages the graph structure information to aggregate attributes from neighboring nodes, thereby enhancing the model-aware and model-agnostic attributes. Furthermore, GraphRank combines the above attributes with a binary classifier, using it as a ranking model to prioritize inputs. This classifier undergoes iterative training, which enables it to learn from each round's feedback and improve its performance accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate GraphRank's superiority over existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphRank\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5c5e\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347GNN\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8eGNN\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u8865\u5145\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u805a\u5408\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGraphRank\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphRank\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While these advancements are well-documented, the use of AI-powered tools for Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), such as vulnerability detection and repair, remains underexplored in industry settings. To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69\\% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent.

We further introduce Autoformalization with Soft Unification, which reduces natural language ambiguity and improves formalization quality, enabling more effective use of the theorem prover. An 8B model trained on data constructed with LogicReward surpasses GPT-4o and o4-mini by 11.6\\% and 2\\% on natural language inference and logical reasoning tasks with simple training procedures. Further analysis shows that LogicReward enhances reasoning faithfulness, improves generalizability to unseen tasks such as math and commonsense reasoning, and provides a reliable reward signal even without ground-truth labels.

In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play. Our results, albeit early, suggest a path where agents autonomously gather extensive learning experiences from real-world software repositories, ultimately enabling superintelligent systems that exceed human capabilities in understanding how systems are constructed, solving novel challenges, and autonomously creating new software from scratch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5f08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5f08\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Self-play SWE-RL\uff0cSSR\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e26\u6709\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u7684\u6c99\u7bb1\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u5bf9\u5f08\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e0d\u65ad\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8865\u4e01\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "SSR\u5728SWE-bench Verified\u548cSWE-Bench Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u79ef\u7d2f\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u81ea\u4e3b\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Therefore, search engines have taken over as peoples preferred resource. The How To prefix has become familiar and widely used in various search styles to find solutions to particular problems. This search allows people to find sequential instructions by providing detailed guidelines to accomplish specific tasks. Categorizing instructional text is also essential for task-oriented learning and creating knowledge bases. This study uses the How To articles to determine the multi-label instruction category. We have brought this work with a dataset comprising 11,121 observations from wikiHow, where each record has multiple categories. To find out the multi-label category meticulously, we employ some transformer-based deep neural architectures, such as Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding (XLNet), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), etc. In our multi-label instruction classification process, we have reckoned our proposed architectures using accuracy and macro f1-score as the performance metrics. This thorough evaluation showed us much about our strategys strengths and drawbacks. Specifically, our implementation of the XLNet architecture has demonstrated unprecedented performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.30% and micro and macro average scores of 89.02% and 93%, a noteworthy accomplishment in multi-label classification. This high level of accuracy and macro average score is a testament to the effectiveness of the XLNet architecture in our proposed InstructNet approach.

This lets us label commits, files, and functions along a human/AI axis and trace how AIGCode moves through projects and vulnerability life cycles.\n  Our measurements show three ecological patterns. First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured: AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written. Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting \"AI-induced vulnerabilities\" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers. Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories.\n  We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u4e14\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11AI\u7f3a\u9677\u6269\u6563\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u666e\u53ca\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GitHub\u9876\u7ea7\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4ea4\u53caCVE\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u8ffd\u8e2aAI\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u91ce\u5916AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff08AIGCode\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e862022-2025\u5e74GitHub\u524d1000\u540d\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c7000\u591a\u4e2aCVE\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AIGCode\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ecd\u591a\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f53\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\uff0cAI\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u5e76\u6269\u6563\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u201cAI\u8bf1\u53d1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u201d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u4ee5\u9632\u7f3a\u9677\u6269\u6563\u3002"}}

To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts.

However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation.\n  We introduce \\textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints.\n  We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size.

Reasoning models improve LLM performance in multi-hop QA tasks, which require integrating and reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across different documents to answer a complex question. However, they often introduce substantial computational costs, including increased token consumption and inference latency. To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks. Our findings reveal that reasoning models adopt structured strategies to integrate retrieved and internal knowledge, primarily following two modes: Context-Grounded Reasoning, which relies directly on retrieved content, and Knowledge-Reconciled Reasoning, which resolves conflicts or gaps using internal knowledge. To this end, we propose a novel Lightweight Rerank Reasoning Strategy Framework for RAG (LiR$^3$AG) to enable non-reasoning models to transfer reasoning strategies by restructuring retrieved evidence into coherent reasoning chains. LiR$^3$AG significantly reduce the average 98% output tokens overhead and 58.6% inferencing time while improving 8B non-reasoning model's F1 performance ranging from 6.2% to 22.5% to surpass the performance of 32B reasoning model in RAG, offering a practical and efficient path forward for RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6LiR\u00b3AG\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eRAG\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728RAG\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6LiR\u00b3AG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6LiR\u00b3AG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLiR\u00b3AG\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8698%\u7684\u8f93\u51fatoken\u6d88\u8017\u548c58.6%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e868B\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b6.2%-22.5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e32B\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LiR\u00b3AG\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing bug-finding techniques are either unreliable or expensive. We build on the insight that near misses observed during simulations may point to potential failures. We propose Foresee, a technique that identifies near misses using a misbehavior forecaster that computes possible future states of the ego-vehicle under test. Foresee performs local fuzzing in the neighborhood of each candidate near miss to surface previously unknown failures. In our empirical study, we evaluate the effectiveness of different configurations of Foresee using several scenarios provided in the CARLA simulator on both end-to-end and modular self-driving systems and examine its complementarity with the state-of-the-art fuzzer DriveFuzz. Our results show that Foresee is both more effective and more efficient than the baselines. Foresee exposes 128.70% and 38.09% more failures than a random approach and a state-of-the-art failure predictor while being 2.49x and 1.42x faster, respectively.

However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgentInfer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgentInfer\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAgentCollab\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3001AgentSched\uff08\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u3001AgentSAM\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u7f00\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff09\u3001AgentCompress\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff09\u56db\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728BrowseComp-zh\u548cDeepDiver\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAgentInfer\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u6548token\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.8~2.5\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u6548\u7387\u800c\u975e\u5355token\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002AgentInfer\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Like other open-source software, these systems depend on active maintenance and community engagement to remain reliable and sustainable. However, despite the importance of timely issue resolution for software quality and community trust, little is known about what drives issue resolution speed within SWSs. This paper presents an empirical study of issue management and resolution across a collection of GitHub-hosted SWS projects. We analyze 21,116 issues to investigate how project characteristics, issue metadata, and contributor interactions affect time-to-close. Specifically, we address two research questions: (1) how issues are managed and addressed in SWSs, and (2) how issue and contributor features relate to issue resolution speed. We find that 68.91% of issues are closed, with half of them resolved within 18.09 days. Our results show that although SWS projects follow structured issue management practices, the issue resolution speed varies considerably across systems. Factors such as labeling and assigning issues are associated with faster issue resolution. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for developers to better manage SWS repository issues and improve their quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86GitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "SWS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u800c\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u793e\u533a\u4fe1\u4efb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6258\u7ba1\u4e8eGitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u4e2aSWS\u9879\u76ee\u517121,116\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u7279\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u4e92\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u5173\u95ed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b068.91%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u534a\u95ee\u9898\u572818.09\u5929\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u3002SWS\u9879\u76ee\u867d\u7136\u9075\u5faa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7ba1\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002\u6807\u8bb0(labeling)\u548c\u6307\u6d3e(assigning)\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf(SWS)\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6709\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5206\u914d\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u5feb\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This is especially challenging in data-scarce settings. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in few-shot NLP tasks, they are not well-suited for time-series data and are computationally expensive for both training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel EARD framework that combines an autonomous agent and an LLM-based detection model, where the agent acts as a reliable decision-maker for \\textit{early time point determination}, while the LLM serves as a powerful \\textit{rumor detector}. This approach offers the first solution for few-shot EARD, necessitating only the training of a lightweight agent and allowing the LLM to remain training-free. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our approach boosts performance across LLMs and surpasses existing EARD methods in accuracy and earliness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65e9\u671f\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u867d\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672cNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c24\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d1f\u8d23\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u65e9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff0cLLM\u8d1f\u8d23\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5404\u7c7bLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65e9\u671f\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5224\u5b9a\uff0cLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8c23\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.\n  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9401\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u4e94\u5927\u7c7b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728AI\u7f16\u7801\u52a9\u624b\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u9879\u76ee\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7f16\u7801\u52a9\u624b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u673a\u5668\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9a\u4e49\u9879\u76ee\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9401\u4e2a\u643a\u5e26\u5149\u6807\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e86\u4e94\u5927\u7c7b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a\u60ef\u4f8b\u3001\u6307\u5357\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u4fe1\u606f\u3001LLM\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u9879\u76ee\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u9879\u76ee\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse.\n  In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural language transformations. PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences. PEAK provides an interface that can either be utilized by performance engineers to improve productivity, or driven completely autonomously (e.g., by an AI agent), providing a forward-compatible design that can continue to improve with advances in AI capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEAK\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316GPU\u5185\u6838\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdGPU\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8GPU\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u7ea7\u540e\u53f0\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793a\u4f8b\u7684GPU\u5185\u6838\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316GPU\u5185\u6838\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "PEAK\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5185\u6838\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9CUDA\u3001HIP\u548cHLSL\u4e09\u4e2a\u540e\u7aef\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e8616\u79cd\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5185\u6838\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "PEAK\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5382\u5546\u5e93\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u5382\u5546\u5e93\u652f\u6301\u7684HLSL\u540e\u7aef\u4e5f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u6587\u6863\u6807\u660e\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u65e2\u53ef\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PEAK\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9GPU\u5185\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0bAI\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5382\u5546\u5e93\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u65e0\u5e93\u652f\u6301\u7684HLSL\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

BanglaForge leverages a retrieval-augmented dual-model collaboration paradigm with self-refinement, combining in-context learning, llm-based translation, systematic prompt engineering, and iterative self-refinement based on execution feedback, where a coder generates initial solutions and a reviewer enhances them for robustness. On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BanglaForge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u51fd\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728BLP-2025\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5341\u5206\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "BanglaForge\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u8d23\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u5ba1\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLP-2025\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cBanglaForge\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8684.00%\u7684Pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "BanglaForge\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8684.00%\u7684Pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3001\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

General-purpose tokenizers trained predominantly on English and Latin-script languages exhibit suboptimal performance on morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, resulting in inflated token sequences and reduced compression efficiency. In this work, we present AraToken, an Arabic-optimized tokenizer built on SentencePiece Unigram algorithm with a comprehensive normalization pipeline addressing Arabic-specific orthographic variations including Alif variants, diacritics, and Arabic-Indic numerals. We systematically compare BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece algorithms across multiple configurations, demonstrating that SentencePiece with normalization achieves 18% lower fertility (1.199 vs 1.35 tokens/word) compared to unnormalized baselines. Furthermore, we introduce the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP), a method for integrating the optimized tokenizer into Qwen3-0.6B through vocabulary extension with mean subtoken initialization and selective transformer layer unfreezing. Our experiments show that LEP reduces evaluation loss from 8.28 to 2.43 within 800 training steps on 100K Arabic samples.

Studies of online platforms typically focus on how platform affordances constrain participants' actions, and profit from their labour. We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners.

However, current VSPs often struggle with medical accuracy, consistent roleplaying, scenario generation for VSP use, and educationally structured feedback. We introduce an agentic framework for training general practitioner student skills that unifies (i) configurable, evidence-based vignette generation, (ii) controlled persona-driven patient dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and (iii) standards-based assessment and feedback for both communication and clinical reasoning.

However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6ce8\u5165\u5f0f\u653b\u51fb\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u5bb9\u6613\u5ffd\u89c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9690\u853d\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\uff08SET\uff09\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u4e14\u4f4e\u9891\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u751f\u6210\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u751f\u6210\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "SET\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\uff08>90%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u8f83\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u4f4e25.13%\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5f3a\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SET\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9632\u8303\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities.

Accepted by Radio Electronics Computer Science Control 2025", "summary": "This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates LSTM, CNN, and an Attention mechanism to enhance the classification of web content based on text. Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization. These findings support the broader use of hybrid deep learning approaches in NLP applications, especially where complex, unstructured textual data must be processed and classified with high reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u3001CNN\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GloVe\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210LSTM\u3001CNN\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GloVe\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u57285\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.98\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u73870.94\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u73870.92\uff0cF1\u5206\u65700.93\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u3001LSTM\u6216\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u6216\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e4921\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u805a\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u6316\u6398\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u4eb2\u7f18\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e4921\u4e2a\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u4eb2\u7f18\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once.

Despite increasing emphasis on complex neural architectures, the empirical limits of text-only linguistic modeling remain underexplored. We present a systematic diagnostic evaluation of nine machine learning algorithms on the LIAR benchmark. By isolating lexical features (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic embeddings (GloVe), we uncover a hard \"Performance Ceiling\", with fine-grained classification not exceeding a Weighted F1-score of 0.32 across models. Crucially, a simple linear SVM (Accuracy: 0.624) matches the performance of pre-trained Transformers such as RoBERTa (Accuracy: 0.620), suggesting that model capacity is not the primary bottleneck. We further diagnose a massive \"Generalization Gap\" in tree-based ensembles, which achieve more than 99% training accuracy but collapse to approximately 25% on test data, indicating reliance on lexical memorization rather than semantic inference. Synthetic data augmentation via SMOTE yields no meaningful gains, confirming that the limitation is semantic (feature ambiguity) rather than distributional. These findings indicate that for political fact-checking, increasing model complexity without incorporating external knowledge yields diminishing returns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e25\u91cd\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5728LIAR\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e5d\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u8bcd\u888b\u6a21\u578b\u3001TF-IDF\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff08GloVe\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027SVM\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\u5206\u6790\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528SMOTE\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec5\u4e3a0.32\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027SVM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.624\uff09\u4e0eRoBERTa\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u7ea625%\uff1bSMOTE\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u653f\u6cbb\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

This process is time-consuming and heavily reliant on expert knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating this task, existing approaches either suffer from poor formalization that fails to accurately align with the design intent or rely on solver feedback for data filtering, which is unavailable due to the high simulation costs. To address this challenge, we propose APF, a framework for solver-independent, automated problem formulation via LLMs designed to automatically convert engineers' natural language requirements into executable optimization models. The core of this framework is an innovative pipeline for automatically generating high-quality data, which overcomes the difficulty of constructing suitable fine-tuning datasets in the absence of high-cost solver feedback with the help of data generation and test instance annotation.

We introduce FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language that makes implicit Finite State Machines (FSMs) explicit in natural language prompts, enabling conformance verification through execution trace analysis. The LLM serves as intelligent execution agent: interpreting designer-encoded FSMs to execute specified behavioral roles. Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36).

Neologisms can be used to encourage specific behavior in models, for example by appending prompts with \"Give me a neologism answer.\" Behavioral steering can also be achieved through fine-tuning, albeit with more compute and less flexibility: learning a neologism only trains d parameters and allows the user to still access the model's default behavior. We compare the performance of neologism learning against low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, finding that neologisms outperform fine-tuned models under a matched training setup (same data and hyperparameters). We also investigate self-verbalizations of neologisms, and observe that the model will occasionally make up its own new words when asked about a neologism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8bcd\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b0\u8bcd\u53ea\u8c03\u6574\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\"\u65b0\u8bcd\"\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b0\u8bcd\u6c47\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94(LoRA)\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65b0\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b0\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u8bcd\u65f6\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u81ea\u884c\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u8bcd\u6c47\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u81ea\u884c\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u8bcd\u3002"}}

Legal Machine Translation (L-MT) offers a scalable solution to this challenge by enabling accurate and accessible translations of legal documents. This paper presents our work for the JUST-NLP 2025 Legal MT shared task, focusing on English-Hindi translation using Transformer-based approaches. We experiment with 2 complementary strategies, fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch using the provided legal corpus. Performance is evaluated using standard MT metrics, including SacreBLEU, chrF++, TER, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and COMET. Our fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieves a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, significantly outperforming both baseline and from-scratch models.

We create different dataset variants to study label standardization and PII representation, covering 24 standardized PII categories and higher-granularity settings. Evaluation using entity-level and character-level metrics, type accuracy, and exact match shows that both lightweight models achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs for PII masking tasks. Label normalization consistently improves performance across architectures. Mistral achieves higher F1 and recall with greater robustness across PII types but incurs significantly higher generation latency. T5, while less robust in conversational text, offers more controllable structured outputs and lower inference cost, motivating its use in a real-time Discord bot for real-world PII redaction.

Existing approaches such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback are data intensive and computationally expensive, while static parameter editing methods struggle with context dependent errors and catastrophic forgetting.\n  We propose LLM-CAS, a framework that formulates real-time hallucination correction as a hierarchical reinforcement learning problem. LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context. Unlike prior dynamic approaches that rely on heuristic or predefined adjustments, this policy driven mechanism enables adaptive and fine grained correction without permanent parameter modification.\n  Experiments across multiple language models demonstrate that LLM-CAS consistently improves factual accuracy, achieving gains of 10.98 percentage points on StoryCloze, 2.71 points on TriviaQA, and 2.06 points on the MC1 score of TruthfulQA. These results outperform both static editing methods such as ITI and CAA and the dynamic SADI framework.

Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments.

World models offer a potential way to improve learning efficiency through simulated experience, but it remains unclear whether large language models can reliably serve this role and under what conditions they meaningfully benefit agents. We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, these gains depend critically on behavioral coverage and environment complexity, delineating clear boundry on when world modeling effectively supports agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u6717\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6587\u672c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ca\u542f\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u7528\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This approach reveals that nearly 60% of tokens across these independently collected corpora are duplicates, redundancy that any new scraping efforts will reproduce.

While this technology promises gains in efficiency, its unstructured adoption risks weakening professional autonomy, amplifying bias, and eroding linguistic and conceptual diversity. This paper argues that a human-centered approach to artificial intelligence has become a necessity for terminology work. Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist. The paper concludes by stressing that current choices in AI adoption will shape not only terminological practice, but also the preservation of accuracy, adequacy, and diversity in terminology and specialized knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u672f\u8bed\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53d6\u800c\u4ee3\u4e4b\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5728\u672f\u8bed\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u5f3a\u4eba\u63a7\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u6563\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u4e13\u4e1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u3001\u52a0\u91cd\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u4f26\u7406AI\u53ca\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u517c\u5bb9\u3001\u672f\u8bed\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u4e2d\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u672f\u8bed\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e5f\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5207\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

Human-AI Difficulty Alignment with Proficiency Simulation for Item Difficulty Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate estimation of item (question or task) difficulty is critical for educational assessment but suffers from the cold start problem. While Large Language Models demonstrate superhuman problem-solving capabilities, it remains an open question whether they can perceive the cognitive struggles of human learners. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations.

Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduce Remedy-R, a reasoning-driven generative MT metric trained with reinforcement learning from pairwise translation preferences, without requiring error-span annotations or distillation from closed LLMs. Remedy-R produces step-by-step analyses of accuracy, fluency, and completeness, followed by a final score, enabling more interpretable assessments. With only 60K training pairs across two language pairs, Remedy-R remains competitive with top scalar metrics and GPT-4-based judges on WMT22-24 meta-evaluation, generalizes to other languages, and exhibits strong robustness on OOD stress tests.

Building on this finding, we introduce Remedy-R Agent, a simple evaluate-revise pipeline that leverages Remedy-R's evaluation analysis to refine translations.

Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u957f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f29\u77ed\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u63d2\u503c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u906e\u853d\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u65e9\u786e\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff08\u7ea6\u51cf\u5c1135%\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u9884\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u5c55\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Our framework combines rulebased analysis with LLM-based labeling and statistical metrics, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation.

Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROG\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ROG\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5c5e\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ROG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002ROG\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u7d27\u51d1\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aROG\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5e93\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on mathematical analysis of model weights and activations, SAP incorporates both the syntactic structure and attention patterns of sentences to guide the pruning process. By leveraging these linguistic features, SAP not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the interpretability of model behavior. To further improve robustness, we propose Candidate Filtering (CF), a mechanism that prioritizes heads based on their contribution to model performance, mitigating degradation during pruning. Experimental results indicate that SAP effectively preserves critical heads of a high density of strong attention values, outperforming existing head pruning strategies in retrain-free settings. These findings position SAP as a promising foundation for a new direction in model compression research, offering high flexibility for pruning across all transformer-based language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5SAP\uff0c\u914d\u5408CF\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524dTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSyntactic Attention Pruning (SAP)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u5b50\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u53e6\u5916\u5f15\u5165Candidate Filtering (CF)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5404\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4f18\u5148\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u88c1\u526a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAP\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u542b\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5934\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm.

Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity.

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c61\u540d\u7fa4\u4f53\u65f6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5371\u6c61\u540d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6c61\u540d\u7fa4\u4f53\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6c61\u540d\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7SocialStigmaQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u6b3e\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u5bf993\u4e2a\u6c61\u540d\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6c61\u540d\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5371\u6c61\u540d\uff08\u5982\u5e2e\u6d3e\u6210\u5458\u3001\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\uff09\u504f\u89c1\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6c61\u540d\u504f\u89c1\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u610f\u56fe\u5931\u8d25\u53ca\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u6539\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6c61\u540d\u7fa4\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u867d\u6709\u6539\u5584\u4f46\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Current solutions face a fundamental dilemma. Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemATP\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5316\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8026\u5408\u6216\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChemATP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8be5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "ChemATP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0cChemATP\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts, combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and automatic CoT synthesis (Auto-CoT) to generate highly effective task-specific prompts. Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value.

To that end, we have developed CienaLLM, a modular framework based on schema-guided Generative Information Extraction. CienaLLM uses open-weight Large Language Models for zero-shot information extraction from news articles, and supports configurable prompts and output schemas, multi-step pipelines, and cloud or on-premise inference. To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost. While evaluated in droughts, the schema-driven and model-agnostic design is suitable for adapting to related information extraction tasks (e.g., other hazards, sectors, or languages) by editing prompts and schemas rather than retraining.

However, a critical challenge remains in ensuring LLMs generate factually accurate responses about programming concepts, technical implementations, etc. Most previous code-related benchmarks focus on code execution correctness, overlooking the factual accuracy of programming knowledge. To address this gap, we present CodeSimpleQA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of code LLMs in answering code-related questions, which contains carefully curated question-answer pairs in both English and Chinese, covering diverse programming languages and major computer science domains. Further, we create CodeSimpleQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction corpus with 66M samples, and develop a post-training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive evaluation of diverse LLMs reveals that even frontier LLMs struggle with code factuality.

In addition, its environment lacks key application categories, such as e-commerce and enterprise communication, and does not reflect realistic mobile-use scenarios characterized by vague user instructions and hybrid tool usage. To bridge this gap, we introduce MobileWorld, a substantially more challenging benchmark designed to better reflect real-world mobile usage, comprising 201 tasks across 20 applications, while maintaining the same level of reproducible evaluation as AndroidWorld. The difficulty of MobileWorld is twofold. First, it emphasizes long-horizon tasks with cross-application interactions: MobileWorld requires nearly twice as many task-completion steps on average (27.8 vs. 14.3) and includes far more multi-application tasks (62.2% vs. 9.5%) compared to AndroidWorld. Second, MobileWorld extends beyond standard GUI manipulation by introducing novel task categories, including agent-user interaction and MCP-augmented tasks. To ensure robust evaluation, we provide snapshot-based container environment and precise functional verifications, including backend database inspection and task callback APIs. We further develop a planner-executor agentic framework with extended action spaces to support user interactions and MCP calls. Our results reveal a sharp performance drop compared to AndroidWorld, with the best agentic framework and end-to-end model achieving 51.7% and 20.9% success rates, respectively. Our analysis shows that current models struggle significantly with user interaction and MCP calls, offering a strategic roadmap toward more robust, next-generation mobile intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5MobileWorld\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u94fe\u548c\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u4e25\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AndroidWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u5df2\u8d8b\u8fd1\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u7535\u5546\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u6a21\u7cca\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u8bc4\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b201\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c20\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6MobileWorld\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u94fe\u3001\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001MCP\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u7167\u5bb9\u5668\u73af\u5883\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6267\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cMCP\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "result": "MobileWorld\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8eAndroidWorld\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a51.7%\u548c20.9%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cMCP\u8c03\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "MobileWorld\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, we used activations to fit probes and further analyzed the effects of different models and input content of LLMs on this discriminative power. By computing the directions of essays across various trait dimensions under different prompts, we analyzed the variation in evaluation perspectives of large language models concerning essay types and traits.

We evaluated the framework across 13 humanitarian events, including natural disasters and conflicts, using more than 1,100 documents from verified sources such as ReliefWeb. The generated questions achieved 84.7 percent relevance, 84.0 percent importance, and 76.4 percent urgency. The extracted answers reached 86.3 percent relevance, with citation precision and recall both exceeding 76 percent. Agreement between human and LLM based evaluations surpassed an F1 score of 0.80.

Yet LLM based pipelines face deployment gaps, including hallucinations under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts and across documents, and limited long horizon knowledge management within a bounded context window. We argue that EE should be viewed as a system component that provides a cognitive scaffold for LLM centered solutions. Event schemas and slot constraints create interfaces for grounding and verification; event centric structures act as controlled intermediate representations for stepwise reasoning; event links support relation aware retrieval with graph based RAG; and event stores offer updatable episodic and agent memory beyond the context window. This survey covers EE in text and multimodal settings, organizing tasks and taxonomy, tracing method evolution from rule based and neural models to instruction driven and generative frameworks, and summarizing formulations, decoding strategies, architectures, representations, datasets, and evaluation. We also review cross lingual, low resource, and domain specific settings, and highlight open challenges and future directions for reliable event centric systems. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions that are central to the LLM era, aiming to evolve EE from static extraction into a structurally reliable, agent ready perception and memory layer for open world systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6784\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8de8\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u69fd\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\uff08EE\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6307\u51faLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u8054\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3aLLM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u69fd\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6f14\u8fdb\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

Our goal is to provide an informative, balanced comparison framework that considers both performance outcomes and computational cost.

We continue HuBERT pre-training with supervision based on a phonetic-to-articulatory feature mapping in 55 languages.

Through comprehensive ABX discriminability testing, we show MauBERT models produce more context-invariant representations than state-of-the-art multilingual self-supervised learning models.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to automate this process, acting as judges to evaluate summaries with respect to the original text. While previous research investigated the alignment between LLMs and Human responses, it is not yet well understood what properties or features are exploited by them when asked to evaluate based on a particular quality dimension, and there has not been much attention towards mapping between evaluation scores and metrics. In this paper, we address this issue and discover features aligned with Human and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) responses by studying statistical and machine learning metrics. Furthermore, we show that instructing GPTs to employ metrics used by Human can improve their judgment and conforming them better with human responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5f15\u5bfcGPT\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u4f9d\u636e\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u8f83\u5c11\u88ab\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fGPTs\uff09\u5728\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfcGPTs\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53caGPT\u54cd\u5e94\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8ba9GPT\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8bc4\u5224\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5bfcGPTs\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u6458\u8981\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u4ef7\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Our study focuses on two extremely under-resourced languages: Bribri, a Chibchan language spoken in Costa Rica, and Cook Islands M\u0101ori, a Polynesian language spoken in the Cook Islands. Specifically, this paper: (i) compares algorithms for diacritics restoration in under-resourced languages, including tonal diacritics, (ii) examines the amount of data required to achieve target performance levels, (iii) contrasts results across varying resource conditions, and (iv) explores the related task of diacritic correction. We find that fine-tuned, character-level LLMs perform best, likely due to their ability to decompose complex characters into their UTF-8 byte representations. In contrast, massively multilingual models perform less effectively given our data constraints. Across all models, reliable performance begins to emerge with data budgets of around 10,000 words.

While supervised learning approaches dominate this field, the scarcity and high cost of annotated data for new domains present significant barriers. We argue that leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting is a practical alternative where resources for data annotation are limited. In this work, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique that utilises an intermediate Unified Meaning Representation (UMR) to structure the reasoning process for the ACSA task. We evaluate this UMR-based approach against a standard CoT baseline across three models (Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini-2.5-Pro) and four diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that UMR effectiveness may be model-dependent.

We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative environment simulator. Unlike traditional methods that evolve models on static datasets, GenEnv instantiates a dataevolving: the simulator acts as a dynamic curriculum policy, continuously generating tasks specifically tailored to the agent's ``zone of proximal development''. This process is guided by a simple but effective $\u03b1$-Curriculum Reward, which aligns task difficulty with the agent's current capabilities. We evaluate GenEnv on five benchmarks, including API-Bank, ALFWorld, BFCL, Bamboogle, and TravelPlanner. Across these tasks, GenEnv improves agent performance by up to \\textbf{+40.3\\%} over 7B baselines and matches or exceeds the average performance of larger models. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro-based offline data augmentation, GenEnv achieves better performance while using 3.3$\\times$ less data.
