An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts."}

To fill this gap, this study introduces the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), a graphical notation developed to systematically guide VDT modelling. This notation includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. To evaluate its practical utility, the VDMN was applied in two case studies and assessed through expert interviews. The results show that the notation supports a consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs. The VDMN thus represents a significant step towards the systematisation and standardisation of VDT modelling."}

However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior.

Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process. In this work, we present a survey that examines the above needs with the participation of 68 developers, while we have examined which factors affect practitioners' needs. Most developers express a need for more automated tools, while privacy experience increases practitioners' concerns for privacy tools. Our results can assist practitioners in better positioning their development activities within privacy law compliance and point to an urgent need for privacy facilitators."}

Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive PCOS knowledge graph to ensure verifiable, evidence-based decision-making. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and specialized clinical datasets, benchmarking against nine diverse baselines, demonstrate that Mapis significantly outperforms competitive methods. On the clinical dataset, it surpasses traditional machine learning models by 13.56%, single-agent by 6.55%, and previous medical multi-agent systems by 7.05% in Accuracy."}

A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "comment": "17 pages, references to prior work arXiv:2509.16297 and arXiv:2511.06073", "summary": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.\n  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.\n  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility."}

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0. We also launch CapabilityBench, a public registry of model evaluations against community-contributed policies, shifting evaluation from intelligence benchmarks toward capability measurement."}

We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models."}

Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate.

We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS).

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs."}

To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art."}

Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning."}

BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy."}

Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified.

Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O).

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture."}

The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine.

To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT.

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques."}

We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others).

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications."}

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens."}

PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task.

We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials."}

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware."}

The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system.

Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs."}

In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases."}

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low."}

Exploring LoRA Rank Trade-offs for Retaining Knowledge and Domain Robustness", "comment": "Accepted at AACL IJCNLP 2025", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns."}

Oral Presentation", "summary": "State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information."}

A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting."}

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations."}

However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior.
