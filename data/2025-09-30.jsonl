Particularly, in most cases, smart contracts are compiled as\nbytecode, whose class-level information (e.g., inheritance, virtual function\ntable), and even semantics (e.g., control flow and data flow) are fully\nobscured as a single smart contract after compilation.\n  In this paper, we propose Satellite, a new bytecode-level static analysis\nframework for subcontract misuse vulnerability (SMV) detection in smart\ncontracts. Satellite incorporates a series of novel designs to enhance its\noverall effectiveness.. Particularly, Satellite utilizes a transfer learning\nmethod to recover the inherited methods, which are critical for identifying\nsubcontract reuse in smart contracts. Further, Satellite extracts a set of\nfine-grained method-level features and performs a method-level comparison, for\nidentifying the reuse part of subcontract in smart contracts. Finally,\nSatellite summarizes a set of SMV indicators according to their types, and\nhence effectively identifies SMVs. To evaluate Satellite, we construct a\ndataset consisting of 58 SMVs derived from real-world attacks and collect\nadditional 56 SMV patterns from SOTA studies. Experiment results indicate that\nSatellite exhibits good performance in identifying SMV, with a precision rate\nof 84.68% and a recall rate of 92.11%. In addition, Satellite successfully\nidentifies 14 new/unknown SMV over 10,011 real-world smart contracts, affecting\na total amount of digital assets worth 201,358 USD."}

TENET\nfeatures three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a\nconcise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a\ntailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with\ninteractive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that\niteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code\nrefinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval\nbenchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17\npercentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of\ntest-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how\ndifferent aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the\nTDD setting."}

Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems\nhave paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching\nmodel, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the\nresponse candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different\nparts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing\nthe proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic\nshift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can\ninfluence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address\nthis problem, we propose a multi-turn \\textbf{R}esponse \\textbf{S}election\n\\textbf{M}odel that can \\textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the\n\\textbf{C}ontext and \\textbf{K}nowledge collection (\\textbf{RSM-DCK}).

Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context\nand knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of\nthe context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant\nparts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching.

However, manually decomposing a task into\na coherent sequence of smaller, logically aggregated steps, commonly referred\nto as workflows, demands considerable effort and specialized domain knowledge.\nWhile FMs can assist in generating such workflows specified in domain-specific\nlanguages (DSLs), achieving accuracy and reliability in this process remains a\nchallenge.\n  This work introduces a framework that leverages static analysis feedback to\nenable FMs to detect and repair defects in the DSL-based workflows they\ngenerate. We begin by presenting the first-ever taxonomy of incidences of\ndefects in FM-generated DSL workflows, categorizing them into 18 distinct\ntypes. Furthermore, we observe a high prevalence of defects across FM-generated\nDSL workflows, with 87.27% of the studied instances containing at least one\ndefect. This, in turn, emphasizes the magnitude of the problem in practice and\nunderscores the necessity for implementing mitigation strategies. Following\nthis, we demonstrate that nine types of these defects can be effectively\nidentified through static analysis of the workflows. For this purpose, we\ndevelop Timon, the first-of-its-kind static analyzer specifically designed for\nFM-generated DSL workflows.

However,\nprogress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,\nhigh-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in\nreducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in\nArabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for\nassisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still\nlargely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active\nlearning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation\ncosts while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning\narchitectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent\nunits (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark\ndatasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard\nArabic and dialectal variations.

Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three\naspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and\ntest distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three\ndifferent base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that\ncontinual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older\nand newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker\nresponses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance\ndegradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,\nshowing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions.

This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.\nIntuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict\nattention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.\nSuch approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and\nclearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity\nbehaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in\neach head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising\nsteps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention\nmethods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to\ncapture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in\nearly denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel\nsparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only\nrequires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them\nacross all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising\nstep. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches\nto sparse attention later to maintain generation quality.

Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."}

Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling\nefficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,\nlinear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it\nfurther demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing\nconsistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings\nestablish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper\nquality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence\nsystems.

Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token\ngeneration through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding\nstrategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence\nthresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting\nin suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,\nwe explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We\npropose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a\nlightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,\nwhether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter\napproximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when\ncorrectly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a\npost-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize\nit (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction\n(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant\ndecoding of padding tokens.

However, these platforms are increasingly misused to\ndisseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive\nadvertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative\nconsequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,\nresearchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio\ncontent moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious\nactors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio\ncontent, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the\neffectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs\nremains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a\nMetamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.\nSpecifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14\nmetamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based\nand Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic\naudio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more\nlikely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five\ncommercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against\nthree kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,\n18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing\ncommercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,\nNextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when\ntesting the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy."}

This paradigm has\nrapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke\nconfiguration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward\nframeworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic\nmulti-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM\nagent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''\nparadigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the\ndynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this\nlimitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of\nrecursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects\nbespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a\n``\\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of\ndynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in\nresponse to real-time task demands.

Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)\nhave emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing\nstrong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application\nto UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test\nquality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often\ncauses a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically\ntailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests\ntargeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By\ndynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree\nanalysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of\ntokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To\nenable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,\nwhich was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages\nincluding Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two\nrepresentative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration\nwhile preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across\ndifferent dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable\nsolution for efficient UTG in software development.
