In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7CircuChain\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u5f97\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u907f\u514d\u8fdd\u53cd\u6839\u672c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CircuChain\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Control/Trap\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3001SPICE\u4eff\u771f\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5b88\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7100\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9075\u5b88\u7ea6\u5b9a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5408\u89c4-\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u79bb\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u4f46\u7ea6\u5b9a\u8fdd\u89c4\u591a\uff0c\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9075\u5b88\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u5b9a\uff08\u5982\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u548c\u6781\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u9075\u5faa\u3002"}}

Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs -- commonly referred to as Code Language Models (CLMs) -- translate human intent into executable programs. While progress has been driven by advances in scaling and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored: the impact of system prompts on both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs for code generation. We systematically evaluate how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect code assistant. Our experimental setting spans 360 configurations across four models, five system prompts, three prompting strategies, two languages, and two temperature settings. We find that (1) increasing system-prompt constraint specificity does not monotonically improve correctness -- prompt effectiveness is configuration-dependent and can help or hinder based on alignment with task requirements and decoding context; (2) for larger code-specialized models, few-shot examples can degrade performance relative to zero-shot generation, contrary to conventional wisdom; and (3) programming language matters, with Java exhibiting significantly greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python, suggesting language-specific prompt engineering strategies may be necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cJava\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u867d\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e94\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5171360\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e25\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u7684few-shot\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u96f6\u793a\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cJava\u6bd4Python\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7ec6\u8282\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u8d8a\u5177\u4f53\u8d8a\u597d\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fJava\u6bd4Python\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper takes a cross-stack perspective, examining how generative models are being applied from code generation and distributed runtimes through hardware design space exploration to RTL synthesis, physical layout, and verification. Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one. Our analysis covers more than 275 papers spanning eleven application areas across three layers of the computing stack, and distills open research questions that become visible only from a cross-layer vantage point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9886\u57df\u4e94\u5927\u5171\u6027\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u5171\u4eab\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8de8\u793e\u533a\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u89c6\u89d2\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5404\u793e\u533a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3001RTL\u7efc\u5408\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e94\u4e2a\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9886\u57df\u666e\u904d\u9762\u4e34\u4e94\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5371\u673a\u3001\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8de8\u754c\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1b\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e94\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218-\u539f\u5219\u6620\u5c04\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u719f\u548c\u534f\u540c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u6b21\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5171\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6574\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks largely emphasize single-shot, monolithic generation and thus lack the fine-grained assessments required to reflect complex academic research workflows. To fill this gap, we introduce EduResearchBench, the first comprehensive evaluation platform dedicated to educational academic writing. EduResearchBench is built upon our Hierarchical Atomic Task Decomposition (HATD) framework, which decomposes an end-to-end research workflow into six specialized research modules (e.g., Quantitative Analysis, Qualitative Research, and Policy Research) spanning 24 fine-grained atomic tasks. This taxonomy enables an automated evaluation pipeline that mitigates a key limitation of holistic scoring, where aggregate scores often obscure specific capability bottlenecks, and instead provides fine-grained, diagnostic feedback on concrete deficiencies. Moreover, recognizing the high cognitive load inherent in scholarly writing, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds competence from foundational skills to complex methodological reasoning and argumentation. Leveraging 55K raw academic samples, we curate 11K high-quality instruction pairs to train EduWrite, a specialized educational scholarly writing model. Experiments show that EduWrite (30B) substantially outperforms larger general-purpose models (72B) on multiple core metrics, demonstrating that in vertical domains, data quality density and hierarchically staged training curricula are more decisive than parameter scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0EduResearchBench\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3EduWrite\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1HATD\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u5757\u548c24\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5229\u75285.5\u4e07\u5b66\u672f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7b5b\u90091.1\u4e07\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3EduWrite\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EduResearchBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u539f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684EduWrite\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "EduResearchBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Building upon the foundations of AI agent architectures and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for multi-agent coordination, this paper introduces the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). ACP provides a standardized framework for Agent-to-Agent (AA) interaction, enabling heterogeneous agents to discover, negotiate, and execute collaborative workflows across disparate environments. We propose a federated orchestration model that integrates decentralized identity verification, semantic intent mapping, and automated service-level agreements.

Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process.

Prior work reveals that LLMs often operate in English centric representation spaces, making cross lingual interpretability a pressing concern. We introduce Indic-TunedLens, a novel interpretability framework specifically for Indian languages that learns shared affine transformations. Unlike the standard Logit Lens, which directly decodes intermediate activations, Indic-TunedLens adjusts hidden states for each target language, aligning them with the target output distributions to enable more faithful decoding of model representations. We evaluate our framework on 10 Indian languages using the MMLU benchmark and find that it significantly improves over SOTA interpretability methods, especially for morphologically rich, low resource languages.

This surfaces a unique safety problem when individual agents form a coalition and \\emph{collude} to pursue secondary goals and degrade the joint objective. In this paper, we present Colosseum, a framework for auditing LLM agents' collusive behavior in multi-agent settings. We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed. Furthermore, we discover ``collusion on paper'' when agents plan to collude in text but would often pick non-collusive actions, thus providing little effect on the joint task.

While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations. This approach significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution for support engineers and improves the user experience by transforming cryptic error codes into actionable insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6e90\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f51\u9875\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u53cd\u6620\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u5173\u8054\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3001API\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65e5\u5fd7\u7b49\u591a\u6e90\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1API\u5951\u7ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u591a\u6e90\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5173\u8054\u6765\u81ea\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3001API\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6613\u61c2\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6545\u969c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6666\u6da9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Therefore, a new CGRA DeBERTa, a concept guided residual domain augmentation transformer framework, is proposed that enhances theological QA over Hadith corpora. The CGRA DeBERTa builds on a customized DeBERTa transformer backbone with lightweight LoRA based adaptations and a residual concept aware gating mechanism. The customized DeBERTa embedding block learns global and positional context, while Concept Guided Residual Blocks incorporate theological priors from a curated Islamic Concept Dictionary of 12 core terms. Moreover, the Concept Gating Mechanism selectively amplifies semantically critical tokens via importance weighted attention, applying differential scaling from 1.04 to 3.00. This design preserves contextual integrity, strengthens domain-specific semantic representations, and enables accurate, efficient span extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper reports the results of training CGRA using a specially constructed dataset of 42591 QA pairs from the text of Sahih alBukhari and Sahih Muslim. While BERT achieved an EM score of 75.87 and DeBERTa one of 89.77, our model scored 97.85 and thus surpassed them by 8.08 on an absolute scale, all while adding approximately 8 inference overhead due to parameter efficient gating. The qualitative evaluation noted better extraction and discrimination and theological precision. This study presents Hadith QA systems that are efficient, interpretable, and accurate and that scale provide educational materials with necessary theological nuance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CGRA DeBERTa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u53e4\u5178\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6587\u672c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u548cDeBERTa\u3002", "motivation": "\u53e4\u5178\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e13\u4e1a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u7684DeBERTa\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCGRA DeBERTa\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u9886\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u53e4\u5178\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89e3\u7b54\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u7684DeBERTa\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u8bcd\u5178\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b42591\u5bf9\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684Sahih al-Bukhari\u548cSahih Muslim\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCGRA DeBERTa\u6a21\u578b\u5728EM\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097.85\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u768475.87\u548cDeBERTa\u768489.77\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u7ea68%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u8d28\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u795e\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CGRA DeBERTa\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u53e4\u5178\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6587\u672c\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u795e\u5b66\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

Previously posted on SSRN: https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5828849", "summary": "Software repositories provide a detailed record of software evolution by capturing developer interactions through code-related activities such as pull requests and modifications. To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions.

Through set-theoretic and discrete geometric principles, MM operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing effectively manipulate digital images by modifying local structures via structuring elements (SEs), while cubical homology captures global topological features such as connected components and loop structures within images. Building on the GUDHI package for persistent homology (PH) computation on cubical complexes, we propose the MMPersistence library, which integrates MM operations with diverse SEs and PH computation to extract multiscale persistence information. By employing SEs of different shapes to construct topological filtrations, the proposed MM-based PH framework encodes both spatial and morphological characteristics of digital images, providing richer local geometric information than conventional cubical homology alone and establishing a unified foundation for analyzing digital images that integrates topological insight with morphological image processing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MMPersistence\u5e93\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7acb\u65b9\u590d\u5f62\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u53ea\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u8fbe\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\uff08MM\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\uff08PH\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7d20\uff08SE\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5728MMPersistence\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMM\u64cd\u4f5c\u548cPH\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7acb\u65b9\u540c\u8c03\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While most existing benchmarks assume simple, perfectly documented tools, real-world tools (e.g., general \"search\" APIs) are often opaque, lacking clear best practices or failure modes. Can LLM agents improve their performance in environments with opaque tools by interacting and subsequently improving documentation? To study this, we create OpaqueToolsBench, a benchmark consisting of three distinct task-oriented environments: general function calling, interactive chess playing, and long-trajectory agentic search. Each environment provides underspecified tools that models must learn to use effectively to complete the task. Results on OpaqueToolsBench suggest existing methods for automatically documenting tools are expensive and unreliable when tools are opaque. To address this, we propose a simple framework, ToolObserver, that iteratively refines tool documentation by observing execution feedback from tool-calling trajectories. Our approach outperforms existing methods on OpaqueToolsBench across datasets, even in relatively hard settings.

This study introduces the Linguistic eXtractor (LX), a fine-tuned, large language model trained on consumer-authored text that also has been labeled with consumers' self-reported ratings of 16 consumption-related emotions and four evaluation constructs: trust, commitment, recommendation, and sentiment. LX consistently outperforms leading models, including GPT-4 Turbo, RoBERTa, and DeepSeek, achieving 81% macro-F1 accuracy on open-ended survey responses and greater than 95% accuracy on third-party-annotated Amazon and Yelp reviews. An application of LX to online retail data, using seemingly unrelated regression, affirms that review-expressed emotions predict product ratings, which in turn predict purchase behavior. Most emotional effects are mediated by product ratings, though some emotions, such as discontent and peacefulness, influence purchase directly, indicating that emotional tone provides meaningful signals beyond star ratings. To support its use, a no-code, cost-free, LX web application is available, enabling scalable analyses of consumer-authored text.

Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models are used to extract signals and behavioral logic to automatically generate Gherkin scenarios, which are then converted into runnable test scripts. The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration standardizes signal references, supporting portability across subsystems and test benches. The pipeline uses retrieval-augmented generation to preselect candidate VSS signals before mapping. We evaluate the approach on the safety-relevant Child Presence Detection System, executing the generated tests in a virtual environment and on an actual vehicle. Our evaluation covers Gherkin validity, VSS mapping quality, and end-to-end executability. Results show that 32 of 36 requirements (89\\%) can be transformed into executable scenarios in our setting, while human review and targeted substitutions remain necessary.

While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.9 on LoCoMo and 91.6 on LongMemEval-S using GPT-4.1-mini.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mnemis\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5168\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "Mnemis\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMnemis\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684System-1\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684System-2\u5168\u5c40\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "Mnemis\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u904d\u5386\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u987b\u9884\u8bbe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u539f\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u91cd\u6784\u524d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b019-35%\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7ea621%\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u672a\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Knowledge graphs provide a compact symbolic substrate for factual grounding, but integrating graph structure with neural models is nontrivial: naively embedding graph facts into prompts leads to inefficiency and fragility, while purely symbolic or search-heavy approaches can be costly in retrievals and lack gradient-based refinement. We introduce NeuroSymActive, a modular framework that combines a differentiable neural-symbolic reasoning layer with an active, value-guided exploration controller for Knowledge Graph Question Answering. The method couples soft-unification style symbolic modules with a neural path evaluator and a Monte-Carlo style exploration policy that prioritizes high-value path expansions. Empirical results on standard KGQA benchmarks show that NeuroSymActive attains strong answer accuracy while reducing the number of expensive graph lookups and model calls compared to common retrieval-augmented baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NeuroSymActive\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u6216\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NeuroSymActive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u7edf\u4e00\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u5f84\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroSymActive\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroSymActive\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of slang awareness in Indian English (en-IN) and Australian English (en-AU) across seven state-of-the-art language models. We construct two complementary datasets: \\textsc{web}, containing 377 web-sourced usage examples from Urban Dictionary, and \\textsc{gen}, featuring 1,492 synthetically generated usages of these slang terms, across diverse scenarios. We assess language models on three tasks: target word prediction (TWP), guided target word prediction (TWP$^*$) and target word selection (TWS). Our results reveal four key findings: (1) Higher average model performance TWS versus TWP and TWP$^*$, with average accuracy score increasing from 0.03 to 0.49 respectively (2) Stronger average model performance on \\textsc{web} versus \\textsc{gen} datasets, with average similarity score increasing by 0.03 and 0.05 across TWP and TWP$^*$ tasks respectively (3) en-IN tasks outperform en-AU when averaged across all models and datasets, with TWS demonstrating the largest disparity, increasing average accuracy from 0.44 to 0.54.

Existing approaches either rely on modular system designs with extensive agent orchestration or employ over-simplified instruction schemas, providing limited guidance and poor generalizability. This paper introduces an orchestration-free framework using Task-Oriented Flowcharts (TOFs) to enable end-to-end automation without manual intervention. We first define the components and evaluation metrics for TOFs, then formalize a cost-efficient flowchart construction algorithm to abstract procedural knowledge from service dialogues.

We investigate this question through a case study on Tulu, a Dravidian language with over 2 million speakers but minimal digital presence. Rather than fine-tuning an LLM, we examine whether structured prompts alone can elicit basic conversational ability under controlled prompting. We systematically tackle various challenges posed by absence of training data for Tulu by combining explicit grammar documentation, negative constraints to suppress high-probability tokens from related languages, romanization standardization, and quality-controlled synthetic data generation via self-play. Evaluated on a manually curated held-out set across three LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 70B) and validated by native speakers, our approach reduces vocabulary contamination from 80% to 5% while achieving 85% grammatical accuracy.

Work in progress", "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

We address this problem in a large collection of Finnish World War II Karelian evacuee family interviews. Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly.\n  We develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is).

These agents filter, prioritize, and synthesize information retrieved from the platforms' back-end databases or via web search. In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u606f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7528\u6237\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9LLM\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5448\u73b0\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u504f\u597d\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u6e90\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u516d\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5408\u6210\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u53d7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u907f\u514d\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLM\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u8d77\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

While primarily studied in clinical settings, online patient platforms like medical subreddits may hold complementary insights: treatment expectations that patients feel unnecessary or uncomfortable to share elsewhere. Despite this, no studies examine what type of expectations users discuss online and how they express them. Presumably this is because expectations have not been studied in natural language processing (NLP) before. Therefore, we introduce the task of Expectation Detection, arguing that expectations are relevant for many applications, including opinion mining and product design. Subsequently, we present a case study for the medical domain, where expectations are particularly crucial to extract. We contribute RedHOTExpect, a corpus of Reddit posts (4.5K posts) to study expectations in this context. We use a large language model (LLM) to silver-label the data and validate its quality manually (label accuracy ~78%). Based on this, we analyze which linguistic patterns characterize expectations and explore what patients expect and why. We find that optimism and proactive framing are more pronounced in posts about physical or treatment-related illnesses compared to mental-health contexts, and that in our dataset, patients mostly discuss benefits rather than negative outcomes.

To assess translation performance, we construct a novel benchmark covering LB-FR, LB-EN, and LB-FR using human-translated data from Luci, a tourist magazine about Luxembourg. Training data stems from LuxAlign, a parallel corpus of multilingual Luxembourgish news articles, and LB parliamentary transcripts augmented with Google Translate. We filter the data using LuxEmbedder, LB sentence embeddings, to remove low-equivalence segment-pairs.

However, training high-quality MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive. A promising alternative is to convert pretrained dense models into sparse MoEs. Existing dense-to-MoE methods fall into two categories: \\textbf{dynamic structural pruning} that converts dense models into MoE architectures with moderate sparsity to balance performance and inference efficiency, and \\textbf{downcycling} approaches that use pretrained dense models to initialize highly sparse MoE architectures. However, existing methods break the intrinsic activation patterns within dense models, leading to suboptimal expert construction. In this work, we argue that the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) mechanism provides a natural blueprint for dense-to-MoE conversion. We show that the fine-grained neural-wise activation patterns of GLU reveal a coarse-grained structure, uncovering an inherent MoE architecture composed of consistently activated universal neurons and dynamically activated specialized neurons. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework that partitions neurons according to their activation patterns and constructs shared experts and specialized routed experts with layer-adaptive configurations. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpertWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods, both as a training-free dynamic structural pruning technique and as a downcycling strategy for superior MoE initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ExpertWeaver\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7a00\u758fMoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfMoE\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u9020\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76GLU\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793aMoE\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5212\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u4e13\u5c5e\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "ExpertWeaver\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "ExpertWeaver\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528GLU\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u5230MoE\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0b\u5faa\u73af\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms the best static workflow methods, with especially pronounced gains on complex and out-of-distribution queries.

However, most existing works treat depression prediction either as a binary label or an overall severity score without explicitly modeling symptom-specific information. This limits their ability to provide symptom-level analysis relevant to clinical screening. To address this, we propose a symptom-specific and clinically inspired framework for depression severity estimation from speech. Our approach uses a symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism that aligns PHQ-8 questionnaire items with emotion-aware speech representations to identify which segments of a participant's speech are more important to each symptom. To account for differences in how symptoms are expressed over time, we introduce a learnable symptom-specific parameter that adaptively controls the sharpness of attention distributions. Our results on EDAIC, a standard clinical-style dataset, demonstrate improved performance outperforming prior works. Further, analyzing the attention distributions showed that higher attention is assigned to utterances containing cues related to multiple depressive symptoms, highlighting the interpretability of our approach.

In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training.

Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\\%, which we term \\emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates.

In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $\u03ba$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u8363\u683c\u539f\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f17\u83b1\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89d2\u8272\u529f\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5317\u6d1b\u666e\u00b7\u5f17\u83b1\u7684\u56db\u5927\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6587\u5b66\u6279\u8bc4\u4e2d\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8363\u683c\u5fc3\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u89d2\u8272\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5341\u516d\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf940\u4e2a\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6709\u6548\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8363\u683c\u539f\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u666e\u904d\u89d2\u8272\u529f\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u5341\u516d\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56db\u5341\u4e2a\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u89d2\u8272-\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe82.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89d2\u8272\u529f\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6545\u4e8b\u8bb2\u8ff0\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u653b\u9632\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u7981\u4ee4\u6216\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u6216\u8bf7\u6c42\u5206\u5272\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9884\u671f\u9891\u7387\uff09\u660e\u786e\u4f53\u73b0\u653b\u9632\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6743\u8861\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u516c\u6b63\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings.

In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations.

While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models. We also find that models are more reliable at citing rows than columns, and struggle more with textual formats than images. Finally, we observe notable differences across model families.
