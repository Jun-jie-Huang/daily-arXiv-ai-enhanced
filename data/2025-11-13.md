Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动归属方法，通过将摘要中的每句话链接到来源文本，采用混合式摘要技术提高归属的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析员在报告信息时必须明确信息来源，现有方法难以自动关联摘要与原始文档，影响归属准确性。

Method: 本文提出利用混合式摘要（自动改写抽取式摘要）结合自定义拓扑结构，识别和分类归属相关错误的比例。

Result: 实验表明，混合式摘要方法在归属任务中表现优异，能够有效减少错误归属情况。

Conclusion: 通过混合式摘要和错误分类方法，可显著改善自动归属的准确性，提升分析报告质量。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了GMTRouter，一种基于异构图的多轮用户与大语言模型（LLM）交互表示方法，实现个性化LLM路由，利用少量样本数据捕捉用户偏好，提升响应准确率和AUC值，同时支持新用户和偏好的适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对LLM响应有多样化的个性化需求，而现有方法缺乏充分的个性化，且不能有效处理用户偏好数据稀缺、噪声大和格式不一致的问题。

Method: GMTRouter通过将用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点构成的异构图表示多轮交互，采用定制的消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架下学习用户偏好，实现个性化路由。

Result: GMTRouter在多个数据集上比强基线模型准确率提升0.9%到21.6%，AUC提升0.006到0.309，表现出色。

Conclusion: GMTRouter能够有效捕捉用户偏好，实现LLM路由个性化，且支持用少样本数据适应新用户和偏好，无需大规模微调。代码已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟社交媒体群组对话的有效性，结果发现LLMs生成的对话有较高的逼真度，部分情况下可骗过人类辨识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能真实模拟社交媒体上的人类群组对话，以支持内容推荐算法测试和内容政策效果预估等应用。

Method: 收集Reddit上的真实人类对话，并利用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o两款LLM生成相同话题的人工对话，通过让参与者判别人机对话进行评估。

Result: LLM生成的对话在39%的情况下被误认为人类内容。尤其是Llama 3生成的对话，参与者仅以56%的准确率判定为AI生成，接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs能生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，既展现了其社交模拟的潜能，也警示了其制造虚假社交内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在解读复杂法律（如美国法典第18卷第175节关于生物武器的规定）中的潜力与风险，提出结合知识图谱与检索增强生成方法（RAG）评估LLMs的法律理解力和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs能分析法律，但存在生成不安全内容（如生物武器制造步骤）的风险，亟需提升其法律推理和安全机制。

Method: 采用知识图谱构建结合RAG技术，系统评估LLMs对相关法律的理解、法律意图识别及潜在风险。通过实验验证其识别违法行为、生成禁令指令和识别非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律推理和安全防护方面存在显著不足，但该方法揭示了改进方向。

Conclusion: 结合更完善的安全协议和法律推理框架，可推动LLMs在敏感法律领域的伦理和安全应用，使其成为维护法律的有力工具。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Soft Preference Learning方法，通过优化KL散度正则项，实现了LLM输出的多样性和准确性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）降低了大型语言模型(LLMs)输出的多样性，原因在于KL散度正则项导致模型偏向多数观点，牺牲了观点和表达的多样性。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，通过解耦KL散度中的熵项和交叉熵项，实现对生成多样性的细粒度控制。

Result: Soft Preference Learning训练的LLMs在复杂任务中准确率更高，输出语义和词汇多样性增强，能够涵盖更广泛的社会观点，且logit校准得到改善。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning在保持模型对齐的同时，实现了输出多样性与准确性的提升，是传统温度调节的帕累托改进。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文开发了面向孟加拉国低收入群体的多语言法律助手Mina，利用多语言嵌入和RAG工具链框架，实现法律检索、推理、翻译及文档生成，成绩优于人类平均水平，提升司法可及性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国低收入群体难以获得负担得起的法律援助，现有AI法律助手不支持孟加拉语，且缺乏对本地司法环境的适配，导致效果有限。

Method: 开发了基于多语言大语言模型的Mina法律助手，采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的链式工具框架，实现法律信息检索、推理、翻译和文档生成，通过交互式聊天界面提供法律草案、引用和通俗解释。

Result: Mina在2022和2023年孟加拉国律师资格考试中表现出75-80%的准确率，达到或超过人类平均水平，展现出良好的法律理解和推理能力。

Conclusion: Mina作为低成本、多语言的AI法律助手，能自动完成关键法律任务，有助于扩大司法服务的覆盖范围，展示了构建特定领域低资源系统及多语言适配的可行性和挑战。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

### [7] [Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595)
*Joongho Kim,Xirui Huang,Zarreen Reza,Gabriel Grand,Kevin Zhu,Ryan Lagasse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于语义相似度的动态剪枝(SSDP)方法，通过在线合并语义冗余，实现对树状思维推理过程的实时聚类和剪枝，大幅提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树状思维方法虽然提升了大语言模型的推理能力，但计算代价高，原因在于不同分支往往探索了语义重复的推理路径，导致大量计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出首个轻量级动态剪枝框架SSDP，结合在线语义合并与并行树搜索技术，实现对相似推理步骤的实时聚类和剪枝。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，SSDP相比最先进的树搜索方法提升推理速度最高达2.3倍，节点探索数减少85-90%，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP提供了一种高效且可扩展的推理策略，显著降低了树状思维推理的计算复杂度，保持良好准确性，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个框架，通过对抗性诱导对大语言模型在封闭领域事实准确性的鲁棒性进行压力测试，发现不同模型在抵抗虚假信息方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险领域的实际应用中，虚假信息（幻觉）问题严重，亟需评估其事实准确性的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计三步框架：1）生成与封闭领域相关的真相和谎言；2）对这些断言进行真假的自我验证；3）测试模型对自身生成谎言的鲁棒性。

Result: 使用五种知名大模型（Claude、GPT、Grok、Gemini、DeepSeek）在电影和小说两个封闭领域评估，发现耐受力从强到弱依次为Claude > GPT和Grok > Gemini和DeepSeek。

Conclusion: 不同大语言模型对对抗性虚假信息的抵抗力差异显著，鉴于大量用户依赖LLM获取信息，这一问题值得高度关注。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [9] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种由模型自身生成模糊有害查询（MHQ）作为攻击向量的"Self-HarmLLM"场景，实验证明在多种模型及条件下存在较高成功率的攻击和绕过防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护主要针对外部攻击者制造有害查询，忽视了模型自身输出可能成为新的攻击源的风险。

Method: 通过生成模糊的有害查询（MHQ）并将其作为输入重新输入到模型，验证能否触发绕过防护（jailbreak），并对不同模型与条件下进行了系统实验和自动与人工评估。

Result: 在GPT-3.5-turbo等模型上，MHQ转换成功率和绕过防护成功率分别最高达65%和41%，且自动评估对绕过成功率存在显著高估。

Conclusion: 模型自身生成的模糊有害查询构成有效攻击场景，需要重新设计防护机制和构建更准确的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [10] [OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598)
*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为OKBench的自动化知识基准测试生成框架，专注于新闻领域，动态评估大模型在不断更新的知识上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态知识问答基准无法反映动态变化的知识，且集中式基准难以跟上大语言模型的快速发展。

Method: OKBench通过自动化的代理框架完成基准的采集、生成、验证和分发，特别在新闻领域实现动态知识基准测试。

Result: 通过对多种开源和专有大模型在新知识上进行评测，发现检索机制能显著缩小小模型和大模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 动态知识基准对评估大语言模型性能极为重要，OKBench为此提供了有效的自动生成和测试框架。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

### [11] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）系统，用于生成儿科语言病理学教学病例，实现了多模型集成和知识库结合，提升文本生成的专业性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动制作临床教学病例耗时且大语言模型缺乏专业知识，易产生错误，需广泛专家修改。

Method: 构建了结合领域知识库和工程化提示模板的多模型RAG系统，支持五种商用和开源大语言模型，设计了涵盖多种病症和年级的测试场景，并采用多维度自动评分标准评估生成病例质量。

Result: 系统技术可行，生成病例结构完整、内在一致、符合临床规范，商用模型略优但开源模型表现尚可，预示着保护隐私的机构应用潜力。

Conclusion: 系统实现了专业知识驱动的病例自动生成，需进一步专家审查和实证验证，未来可拓展至临床决策支持、IEP目标自动生成和临床反思训练等领域。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [12] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

TL;DR: 本文将DisCoCirc形式主义从英语扩展到孟加拉语，并应用于英孟翻译，发现其在结构差异较大的语言间存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估DisCoCirc在简化语言结构和翻译任务中的有效性。

Method: 扩展DisCoCirc框架至孟加拉语，分析其在英孟翻译中的表现，并探讨语言结构差异引发的挑战。

Result: 发现DisCoCirc对大部分语言有效，但因英孟语言结构差异，在处理简单句子时仍存在困难，表现不如前期研究所述。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc在跨语言翻译中存在限制，尤其面对结构差异较大语言，未来需改进，同时该研究展示了语言连接词与布尔逻辑间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法整合多个大型语言模型，可以显著提高急诊疾病诊断的准确率，表明集群模型利用不同模型的优势，推动医疗AI诊断的进步。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于梯度的自适应数据选择方法GrADS，用于大模型的监督微调，显著提高了微调效率和性能，同时缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型领域专用微调资源消耗大，且容易导致对通用能力的性能下降（灾难性遗忘）。

Method: 通过初步训练阶段得到的梯度信息，自适应选择对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本子集，实现高效微调。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等领域实验中，使用GrADS选取的5%训练数据即可超越全量数据微调效果，50%数据则带来显著提升，同时减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法有效提升了领域专用微调的效率与性能，降低资源需求，且能缓解灾难性遗忘问题，未来将开源代码。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 全球自杀是青少年死亡的第二大原因，已有自杀行为者未来自杀风险更高，且许多人通过社交媒体表达自杀意图，因此需要有效的自动识别方法。

Method: 结合CNN用于局部特征提取、BiGRU进行双向序列建模，并应用注意力机制和SHAP可解释性技术，构建综合自杀检测框架。

Result: 在公开数据集上训练和测试，模型准确率达到93.97%，并优于多种先进机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效识别社交媒体文本中的自杀意念，具有较强的预测性能和可解释性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于结构化不确定性的策略来优化大语言模型工具调用，通过建模参数不确定性和多轮澄清，实现了更高任务覆盖率和更少澄清问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型工具调用在面对模糊用户指令时调用错误频发，导致任务失败，亟需改进对不确定性的建模以提高工具调用的正确性和交互效率。

Method: 将工具调用参数的不确定性结构化，通过部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）和完美信息期望值（EVPI）指标进行多轮澄清问题选择，提出SAGE-Agent模型，并构建了包含多领域真实LLM用户模拟的ClarifyBench基准。

Result: SAGE-Agent在模糊任务上覆盖率提高7-39%，澄清问题减少1.5-2.7倍，并通过基于不确定性的强化学习训练，显著提升了When2Call模块的准确率（3B模型从36.5%提升至65.2%，7B模型从36.7%提升至62.9%）。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具调用代理提供了科学高效的决策支持，有效提升了实际应用中的任务成功率和交互效率，是实现工具增强型大语言模型代理的有力途径。

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究使用多种自然语言处理模型自动识别帕金森病患者第一人称叙述中认知过程的类别，发现Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型效果最佳，展示了该技术在认知功能长期监测中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常认知体验有助于深入洞察疾病相关的认知和情绪变化，但由于认知构念微妙且重叠，从非结构化叙述中提取信息具有挑战性。

Method: 本研究开发并比较了三类NLP模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型，使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，以及在零样本和少样本下评估的GPT-4o mini，针对七个认知类别进行性能评估。

Result: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct在整体F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59）上表现最佳，特别擅长处理依赖上下文的类别如思维和社交互动；Bio_ClinicalBERT精准率高但召回率低，在部分类别表现不错，但处理情绪和思维类别表现较差。

Conclusion: 尽管任务难度较大，但这些NLP系统有望实现对帕金森患者认知功能的低负担、长期监测，并可作为正式神经心理评估的有益补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Conclusion: BNLI为孟加拉语及其他低资源语言的自然语言推理研究提供了坚实基础，推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出TACT，一个支持任务导向对话和闲聊无缝切换的数据集，同时引入了评估切换和恢复能力的新指标，提升了对话代理的切换控制和响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话代理通常专注于任务导向或开放式闲聊，难以同步处理两者的自然过渡，现实对话中两者模式常 fluid 交替，需要更能捕捉这一动态转变的模型。

Method: 构建TACT数据集，包含结构多样且融合的模式切换流程，支持用户和机器人双向驱动的模式切换；提出Switch和Recovery两个指标来评估模式切换能力；引入直接偏好优化（DPO）方法提升模型性能。

Result: 基于TACT训练的模型在意图检测和模式切换处理上均优于基线，通过DPO进一步提升，使模型在联合模式意图准确率达75.74%，并在人类评测中以70.1%的胜率击败GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 结合结构多样的数据和DPO方法，可显著提升对话代理的响应质量和模式切换控制能力，推动更主动且具备切换意识的对话系统发展。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Conclusion: BioVerge及其Agent为生物医学假说生成提供标准环境和有效工具，推动利用大语言模型进行更复杂和创新的假说探索。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在引用生成中的幻觉问题，发现文献被模型记忆程度与其引用次数相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于LLMs在引用推荐中存在生成不存在文献（幻觉）的现象，本文探讨引用次数是否能反映模型对文献的记忆程度，进而影响生成的准确性。

Method: 基于GPT-4.1，生成并手动验证了20个计算机科学领域中100个引用的准确性，利用余弦相似度衡量生成与真实元数据的一致性，分析引用频率对幻觉引用的影响。

Result: 发现引用次数与事实准确性高度相关，引用超过约1000次的文献几乎被模型逐字记忆，且高引用文献内容相似时会产生记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 模型记忆和泛化存在阈值划分，引用次数高的文献更可能被模型准确记忆，减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Motivation: 大语言模型尽管表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响事实准确性，需要有效的检测和纠正方法。

Method: HalluClean采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，通过最小任务路由提示实现跨领域零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识或监督检测器。

Result: 在问答、对话、摘要、数学问题和矛盾检测五个任务上，HalluClean显著提升了事实一致性，表现优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: HalluClean有效提升了大语言模型输出的可信度，具有广泛实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在并行生成速度快但质量较低，自回归模型质量高但速度和资源利用率低，如何将两者优势结合成为核心问题。

Method: TiDAR采用序列级混合架构，利用扩散模型进行初稿生成（Thinking），使用自回归模型进行最终采样（Talking），通过设计特殊的结构化注意力掩码实现在一次前向传播中完成。

Result: TiDAR在1.5B和8B规模下，相较于自回归模型、推测解码和扩散模型，在生成速度和质量上均表现优异，生成速度提升4.71至5.91倍。

Conclusion: TiDAR首次实现了扩散模型和自回归模型的优势互补，达到了与自回归相当的生成质量，同时大幅提高了生成效率和GPU利用率。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Conclusion: EVADE框架有助于规模化错误检测，减少人工标注工作量，同时提高数据集中标签变异下的质量和模型性能。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Conclusion: SpiralThinker成功将迭代计算与潜在推理结合，证明了通过对齐的迭代更新能有效引导潜在空间中的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Motivation: 现有评估多基于静态短对话，无法捕捉情感支持的动态和长期特性。

Method: 构建包含328个情绪场景和1152个干扰事件的大规模基准，采用情绪调节策略约束模型输出，利用一阶马尔可夫过程和因果调整方法跟踪用户情绪轨迹，提出三种轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）。

Result: 通过多模型广泛评估，揭示了不同LLM在情感支持能力上的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架有效捕捉和评估了LLM在长期情感支持中的动态表现，为模型改进提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Method: 采用两阶段神经符号框架：（1）利用大语言模型和可选的人类指导将自然语言政策形式化，实现细粒度控制；（2）推理时自动形式化以验证自然语言陈述与政策的逻辑正确性，并通过多重冗余形式化交叉验证语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法生成可审计的逻辑证据支持验证结果，同时可用于改进原始文本，提升自然语言政策的应用可靠性，适合受监管行业需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments.

Motivation: 解决安多藏语流式语音识别中固定分块方法导致的上下文截断问题及提高对藏语语言特征的捕捉能力。

Method: 构建基于编码状态动态调整分块宽度的机制，实现灵活感受野和跨分块信息交换；基于藏语正字法设计词典以提供语言驱动的建模单位；融合外部语言模型提升语义一致性。

Result: 在测试集上实现6.23%的词错误率，较固定分块基线提高48.15%，显著降低识别延迟，同时性能接近全局解码。

Conclusion: 所提动态分块混合CTC/Attention框架有效提升了安多藏语流式语音识别性能和速度，且兼顾了语言特性与语义连贯性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估推理步骤和多目标强化学习，有效提升了检索增强多步推理的性能和质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: 本文通过多维度评估日本即兴喜剧游戏・大喜利的幽默表现，揭示大型语言模型在创造性生成和幽默评判中的优缺点，特别指出其缺乏情感共鸣能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常仅单维评估LLM的幽默能力，忽视了幽默的多维复杂性，难以全面理解和提升LLM的幽默表现。

Method: 扩大了大喜利数据集，加入LLM生成的回答，并在创新性、清晰度、相关性、智慧、共情和整体趣味性六个方面进行5分制人工标注。基于此数据集，评估LLM在大喜利生成和评判能力上的表现。

Result: LLM在幽默生成能力介于低至中等人类水平之间，但在共情方面明显不足，导致它们无法准确模拟人类的幽默评判标准。人类更看重共情，而LLM则偏重创新性。

Conclusion: 多维度的幽默评估揭示了LLM幽默能力的盲点，特别是共情不足。公开数据集有望推动更具情感智能的对话系统发展。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于截断矩阵熵的无训练噪声去除位置编码方法（DoPE），提升Transformer模型中旋转位置编码（RoPE）的长序列外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RoPE在长序列长度外推时性能下降，存在注意力陷阱现象，需要更鲁棒的位置编码方式。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为带噪声的特征图，利用截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，通过无参数高斯分布重参数化来去噪，实现鲁棒的序列外推。

Result: 在大规模上下文（最长达64K tokens）下的检索和多次上下文学习任务中，DoPE显著提升了检索准确性和推理稳定性，有效缓解了注意力陷阱。

Conclusion: 基于噪声去除的位置信息编码策略能有效改善Transformer长度泛化能力，解决了注意力陷阱问题，是提升长序列建模的简洁有效方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具学习方法由于数据生成和模型训练分开进行，难以针对模型弱点进行针对性改进，且存在噪声标签问题，导致训练效率低下。

Method: LoopTool框架包含三个协同模块：利用贪婪能力探测识别模型弱点，采用开放源代码评判模型纠正标签错误，通过错误驱动的数据扩展生成新的挑战性样本，形成数据与模型的闭环迭代训练。

Result: 在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中，使用LoopTool训练的8亿参数模型显著超越32亿参数的数据生成模型，达到新的同类最佳表现。

Conclusion: 闭环自我优化的数据管道能够显著提升大语言模型在工具使用任务上的能力，证明了LoopTool的有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了表格问答准确率，未来计划引入更高效的文本检索模型，进一步提升性能，缩小与人工评价间的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Conclusion: 研究支持使用基于上下文的顺序性作为自动作文评分中有效且易解释的特征，能显著提升评分准确性和模型表现。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统的子词切分在预处理阶段固定，而动态学习子词切分有助于优化训练目标，提升模型表现。

Method: 扩展了子词切分语言模型（SSLM），支持预训练和微调，研究了三种形态学差异显著的语言中子词的学习动态，分析形态学、生产力与生育率等。

Result: 发现子词学习存在四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性，微调阶段子词边界趋于更细粒度。

Conclusion: 动态学习子词切分有助于低资源且形态复杂语言的文本生成与跨语言迁移，提供了一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Conclusion: C$^3$TG为无需复杂模型改动即可实现多维文本属性细粒度控制的高效灵活方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptDel方法，通过动态调整删除率提高序列分类对编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性，理论上保证编辑距离的认证，实验证明性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定删除率方法在处理长度变化的序列输入时表现不佳，导致认证鲁棒性不足。

Method: 引入动态可调删除率的AdaptDel方法，扩展随机平滑理论到可变删除率，实现对编辑距离的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言处理任务中，AdaptDel方法在认证区域中等基数上比当前最先进认证方法提升了最多30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel通过动态调整删除率显著提升了序列分类模型对编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性，具有理论保证和强大实证效果。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了mmJEE-Eval，一个涵盖印度高考物理、化学、数学的多模态双语基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力，揭示了现有顶尖模型在复杂推理任务上的能力瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型虽然在多模态推理基准测试中取得高准确率，但无法有效区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配。本研究旨在通过引入更具挑战性的基准，推动模型科学推理能力的评估。

Method: 构建了包含1460道题目的mmJEE-Eval基准，涵盖英语和印地语的印度JEE高级考试题目，通过对17个先进模型的性能测试，分析其在复杂推理任务中的表现，并对模型进行系统性消融研究。

Result: 顶尖视觉语言模型（如GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash）在新题中表现优异（77-84%准确率），但开源模型即便参数量达到4000亿也仅有37-45%的准确率。增加认知负荷时，顶尖模型表现下降明显，显示推理能力有限。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能够有效区分模型的训练和推理能力，揭示现有模型在复杂科学推理任务上存在的不足，为未来模型的改进和评估提供了新的参考标准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

TL;DR: SeerSC结合系统1与系统2推理，通过动态自洽框架，显著降低了大语言模型推理的Token使用和时延。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的测试时缩放提升大语言模型性能但代价高，且现有动态自洽方法因顺序请求高时延受限。

Method: 利用快速的系统1计算答案熵评估样本规模潜力，结合系统2进行动态自洽，实现并行生成以降低时延。

Result: SeerSC相比现有方法减少Token使用达47%，推理时延降低43%，性能无明显损失。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了大语言模型推理效率，兼顾了性能和计算成本，具备实用价值。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具依赖复杂工具或RDF图，解析准确率较低，且缺少统一的多语言Text-to-Query数据集。

Method: 提出基于纯规则的S2CLite解析器，灵感来自传统编译器，不依赖RDF图或外部工具，实现高效精准的SPARQL到Cypher转换。同时构建Spider4SSC多语言Text-to-Query数据集。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验证明，S2CLite解析准确率达77.8%，远超现有S2CTrans (44.2%)；执行准确率达96.6%，提升7.3%。Spider4SSC数据集包含4525个问题和三种查询语言对应的2581组匹配查询。

Conclusion: S2CLite作为轻量级且高效的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具显著提升了解析和执行性能，Spider4SSC提供了统一的多语言Text-to-Query数据集，有助于后续相关研究和应用。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MTQ-Eval，一个基于大语言模型的多语言文本质量评估框架，通过学习高低质量文本示例，实现跨115种语言的文本质量评估，显著提升了评估准确性并改善了下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型主要用于任务特定的文本输出评估，尚不清楚其在多语言文本质量的通用评价能力。

Method: 通过自动生成文本质量偏好数据，训练开源大语言模型，使其对高低质量文本进行对齐学习，形成MTQ-Eval评估框架。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估显示MTQ-Eval提升了文本质量评估的性能，并促进了相关下游任务的改进。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval有效扩展了大语言模型的文本质量评估能力，实现了多语言环境下的通用评估，并带来了实际应用中的性能提升。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大型语言模型在自我纠正中的两种范式（开放式生成与多选题选择）的性能与错误纠正行为差异，揭示了两者在改进和失败模式上的不同，强调了自我纠正机制设计需结合任务结构和输出空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型展现了通过迭代自我纠正提升回答质量的能力，但其自我纠正机制在开放式文本生成与多选题选择任务中表现或有显著差异，需要系统研究以指导更有效的机制设计。

Method: 通过比较不同规模和类型的语言模型在自然语言理解与推理任务上的表现趋势和错误纠正行为，分析开放式生成与多选题选择两种范式的优缺点及改进模式。

Result: 发现开放式生成可通过灵活的重新解释和组合式细化得到改进，而多选题选择受限于预设选项但边界更明确，两者在改进与失败模式上存在明显不同。

Conclusion: 自我纠正机制的设计应考虑任务结构与输出空间的交互，既要兼顾开放式计划或解释的生成与细化，也需保证在受限动作空间下做出可靠选择，对知识密集型推理与决策方向的应用具有指导意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对离线偏好优化中评分准确率不足问题的算法AMaPO，通过自适应边界调整梯度分配，有效缓解过拟合和欠拟合困境，提高模型排名和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法中，评分准确率受限于边界设计，导致对正确排序样本过度梯度更新（过拟合）而对错误排序样本梯度不足（欠拟合），影响模型性能。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，利用实例自适应边界，通过Z-标准化和指数缩放动态调整学习梯度，放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，AMaPO显著提升了排名准确率和下游任务的对齐性能，同时成功缓解了过拟合与欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO是一种简单但有效的算法，能够权衡和优化离线偏好优化中的梯度分配难题，提升模型对齐的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

TL;DR: 本文开发了适用于低资源语言巴斯克语的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），通过构建图文数据集并测试Llama-3.1-Instruct与巴斯克语适应变体Latxa两个模型，发现少量巴斯克语多模态数据即可取得良好结果，且不必使用专门的巴斯克语指导型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型在低资源语言上的表现尚不理想，特别是在开放科学领域缺少高质量的资源和模型。本文旨在填补这一空白，提升巴斯克语等低资源语言的多模态模型性能。

Method: 构建巴斯克语图文训练和评估数据集，采用两种大语言模型作为骨干（Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适应版Latxa），探索不同数据混合比例进行模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可达到在巴斯克语基准测试上的稳健表现，同时巴斯克语指导型骨干模型并非构建强大MLLM的必要条件。

Conclusion: 本研究为开发其他低资源语言的多模态大型语言模型开辟了道路，通过公开发布资源促进相关研究与应用发展。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: CARE-Bench为心理咨询领域的LLM能力评估提供了更科学全面的工具，有助于指导开发更有效的咨询模型。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本大量存在，如何让文本更易读以方便更广泛的受众，是自动文本简化的研究重点。已有研究关注了自动评估指标与人工判断的相关性，但可读性指标的作用未得到充分研究。

Method: 本文首先讨论ATS与可读性研究的关系，随后通过实证研究分析了可读性指标与人工判断及自动评估指标之间的相关性。

Result: 研究发现可读性指标与自动评估指标及人工判断的相关性普遍较低。

Conclusion: 由于自动文本简化评估的三个角度相关性低，未来需对ATS的简化概念进行明确界定。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

Abstract: As modern software systems continue to grow in complexity, triage has become a fundamental process in system operations and maintenance. Triage aims to efficiently prioritize, assign, and assess issues to ensure the reliability of complex environments. The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated by software systems has made effective triage indispensable for maintaining reliability, facilitating maintainability, and enabling rapid issue response. Motivated by these challenges, researchers have devoted extensive effort to advancing triage automation and have achieved significant progress over the past two decades. This survey provides a comprehensive review of 234 papers from 2004 to the present, offering an in-depth examination of the fundamental concepts, system architecture, and problem statement. By comparing the distinct goals of academic and industrial research and by analyzing empirical studies of industrial practices, we identify the major obstacles that limit the practical deployment of triage systems. To assist practitioners in method selection and performance evaluation, we summarize widely adopted open-source datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a unified perspective on the measurement of triage effectiveness. Finally, we outline potential future directions and emerging opportunities to foster a closer integration between academic innovation and industrial application.

*Jarin Tasnim,Debasish Chakroborti,Chanchal K. Roy,Kevin A. Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在软件回溯维护中产生的新技术债务，分析了3个生态87个仓库中超过10万次回溯提交，发现约4.3%回溯引入新技术债务，且不同生态和版本周期内技术债务表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件维护是持续过程，回溯维护虽保证稳定性却可能引入新的技术债务，理解其产生原因有助于提升维护质量。

Method: 分析了Apache、Eclipse和Python三个生态87个代码库中105,396个回溯提交，研究技术债务产生的时机与原因。

Result: 发现约4.3%的回溯引入新技术债务；Apache绝对数量最多；Python和Eclipse的债务密度高于Apache；不同生态在发布周期不同阶段技术债务积累差异明显；经验不足、高工作负载及非所有者开发者更易引入技术债务。

Conclusion: 回溯维护中技术债务的产生与软件生态、版本周期阶段和开发人员特征密切相关，针对性管理可减少技术债务产生，提高软件维护质量。

Abstract: Maintaining software is an ongoing process that stretches beyond the initial release. Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动生成测试计划的方法，旨在在生产环境中进行实时测试时减少对生产流量的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时测试需在不干扰生产交通的情况下进行，手动设计测试计划繁琐且易出错，尤其是面对大型复杂系统。

Method: 通过自动化方法生成测试计划，包含测试配置选择与生成、部署规划、测试调度和风险缓解策略制定。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了该自动化方法的实用性和效果。

Conclusion: 自动化测试计划生成方法有效减少了测试对生产环境的干扰，提升了测试效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Live testing is performed in the production environment ideally without causing unacceptable disturbance to the production traffic. Thus, test activities have to be orchestrated properly to avoid interferences with the production traffic. A test plan is the road map that specifies how the test activities need to be orchestrated. Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于PLC使用专有代码方言，以及企业对云服务的不信任，现有大模型难以满足IEC 61131-3标准代码及特定功能块需求，亟需本地自主的编程助手。

Method: 本文通过微调小型本地模型，结合多模型竞赛、推理和自动修复功能，同时在聊天界面支持代码编译校验，利用RAG技术并融合提示工程与定向检索提升代码生成性能。

Result: 工具实现了无需大规模模型微调的高质量代码生成，支持PLC标准，评估显示代码编译率和用户评分均表现优异，验证了低数据领域的适用性。

Conclusion: 基于检索增强生成的本地编程助手结合提示工程与定向检索技术，适合低数据工业应用场景，有效提升PLC代码生成的准确度和可靠性。

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPLVD的自适应训练方法，通过动态选择源代码以提升软件漏洞检测的准确率，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在软件漏洞检测中的准确度受限，主要由于训练数据质量低，迫切需要一种能够优化训练过程和数据选择的策略。

Method: 提出SPLVD方法，采用自适应的训练数据选择机制，模拟人类学习由易到难的过程，在每个训练周期动态评估和选取适宜难度的源代码以优化模型训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，SPLVD分别达到89.2%、68.7%和43.5%的F1值，显著优于现有技术；在OpenHarmony项目中也表现出较高的90.9%准确率。

Conclusion: SPLVD通过自适应学习策略有效提升了软件漏洞检测的效果，证明了其在实际漏洞检测任务中的实用价值和优越性。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are major risks to software systems. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AILINKPREVIEWER工具，利用大型语言模型为代码审查中PR中的链接生成预览，以提升审查效率和上下文信息丰富度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化任务通常忽略PR中链接的上下文信息，增加审查负担，影响代码质量和维护性。

Method: 基于PR元数据（标题、描述、评论、链接内容）利用大型语言模型生成链接预览，并比较上下文和非上下文摘要及元数据预览三种方法。

Result: 研究显示上下文摘要在BLEU、BERTScore等指标上表现最佳，但用户研究中大多数参与者更喜欢非上下文摘要，反映性能指标与用户偏好之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 基于大型语言模型的链接预览有助于提升代码审查效率，丰富审查上下文，为开发者和自动化工具提供更有价值的信息。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.

Method: 集成开放权重的LLM，使用高级提示工程技术从软件需求中系统提取角色和用例，并通过与5位专业软件工程师的对比实验验证方法效果。

Result: 使用LLM方法能将建模时间减少60%，同时模型质量与传统方法相当。参与者还认为该方法为建模过程提供了有价值的指导。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的用例建模方法显著提升了建模效率，且不降低模型质量，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

Abstract: Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Routesplain，一种面向软件相关任务的可解释性大模型路由方法，通过提取查询中的人类可理解概念，实现更高准确率和更低成本的模型路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在软件相关任务中的表现差异显著，适当路由用户查询至合适模型能提升响应质量并降低成本，且现有方法缺乏针对软件任务的可解释路由机制。

Method: Routesplain通过提取查询中的任务、领域、推理复杂度等可解释概念，基于这些概念进行路由决策，提供透明且可信的模型选择理由。

Result: 在16个顶尖大模型和8个软件任务上的评测显示，Routesplain在准确率和成本方面均优于单一模型，并可与现有黑盒路由方法持平或更好，且概念级干预为路由改进提供了方向。

Conclusion: Routesplain首次实现了软件相关任务的大模型可解释路由，有效提升了任务性能与成本效率，且其透明性为未来路由器优化提供了可能性。

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 本文框架和指标有效解决了通信效率问题，促进了多智能体系统中通信协议的优化和任务表现提升。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

Motivation: 原PIBT算法虽然速度快，但由于只考虑短时跳，导致在需要方向调整和旋转动作的场景中表现不佳。

Method: 引入多动作操作改进PIBT，并结合图引导技术和大邻域搜索优化，提高算法性能。

Result: 改进后的方法在在线LMAPF-T任务中达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过扩展PIBT的动作空间和优化策略，能够在保持高效率的同时，显著提升多智能体路径规划效果。

Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.
