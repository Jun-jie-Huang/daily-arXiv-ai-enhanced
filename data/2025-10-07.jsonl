Plaintiff and defendant agents choose from a constrained action\nspace (for example, discovery requests, motions, meet-and-confer, sanctions)\ngoverned by a JSON rules engine, while a stochastic judge model with calibrated\ngrant rates, cost allocations, and sanction tendencies resolves outcomes. We\ncompare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM\npolicy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case\noutcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a\ncomposite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar\npressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin.\nAcross configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax\nprocedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'',\nsuch as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that\nremain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful. Evaluation via cross-play\nand Bradley-Terry ratings shows, PPO wins more often, the bandit is the most\nconsistently competitive across opponents, the LLM trails them, and the\nheuristic is weakest.

The existing energy management systems often prioritize\nsystem efficiency (balanced energy demand and supply) at the expense of user\ncomfort. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel decentralized\nmulti-agent coordination-based demand-side management system. The proposed\nsystem enables individual agents to coordinate for demand-side energy\noptimization while improving the user comfort and maintaining the system\nefficiency. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of a slot\nexchange mechanism, where agents first receive optimized appliance-level energy\nconsumption schedules and then coordinate with each other to adjust these\nschedules through slot exchanges. This approach improves user comfort even when\nagents show non-altruistic behaviour, and it scales well with large\npopulations. The system also promotes fairness by balancing satisfaction levels\nacross users.

While sound static analysis\ntools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging.\nPrior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only\nleaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits\nthe scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that\nstore a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes\nfour key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of\nwrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications\ninto the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about\nwrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze,\nmaking inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it\nmakes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a\nclient of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A\nnovel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling\nrepair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a\nnew repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored\nin non-final fields.

This has motivated the use of machine learning models to\npredict human comprehensibility directly from code, but these models have also\nshown limited accuracy.\n  We argue that model inaccuracy stems from inherent noise in human\ncomprehensibility data, which confuses models trained to predict it directly.\nTo address this, we propose training models to predict the relative\ncomprehensibility of two code snippets - that is, predicting which snippet a\nhuman would find easier to understand without predicting each snippet's\ncomprehensibility in isolation. This mitigates noise in predicting 'absolute'\ncomprehensibility measurements, but is still useful for downstream\nsoftware-engineering tasks like assessing whether refactoring improves or\nhinders comprehensibility.\n  We conducted a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of absolute and\nrelative code comprehensibility prediction via machine learning. We used a\ndataset of 150 Java code snippets and 12.5k human comprehensibility\nmeasurements from prior user studies, comparing the models' performance with\nnaive baselines (eg 'always predict the majority class').

In the industry, including\ncompanies specializing in software testing, there is a significant demand for\nthe automatic generation of high-level test cases from requirement documents\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts to utilize LLMs for requirement\nanalysis are underway. In some cases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is\nemployed for generating high-level test cases using LLMs. However, in practical\napplications, it is necessary to create a RAG tailored to the knowledge system\nof each specific application, which is labor-intensive. Moreover, when applying\nhigh-level test case generation as a prompt, there is no established method for\ninstructing the generation of high-level test cases at a level applicable to\nother specifications without using RAG. It is required to establish a method\nfor the automatic generation of high-level test cases that can be generalized\nacross a wider range of requirement documents. In this paper, we propose a\nmethod for generating high-level (GHL) test cases from requirement documents\nusing only prompts, without creating RAGs. In the proposed method, first, the\nrequirement document is input into the LLM to generate test design techniques\ncorresponding to the requirement document. Then, high-level test cases are\ngenerated for each of the generated test design techniques. Furthermore, we\nverify an evaluation method based on semantic similarity of the generated\nhigh-level test cases. In the experiments, we confirmed the method using\ndatasets from Bluetooth and Mozilla, where requirement documents and high-level\ntest cases are available, achieving macro-recall measurement of 0.81 and 0.37,\nrespectively. We believe that the method is feasible for practical application\nin generating high-level test cases without using RAG."}

Its principles\ncontinue to influence contemporary hybrid development frameworks that combine\ntraditional and agile methods. Drawing on a range of scholarly sources, this\nstudy synthesizes key developments in the perception and application of the\nwaterfall model. The analysis highlights how the model has shifted from a\nstandalone framework to a component within modern hybrid methodologies. By\nrevisiting its origins, assessing its present utility, and examining its role\nin contemporary development practices, this paper argues that the waterfall\nmodel remains relevant, not as a relic of the past but as part of context-aware\ndevelopment strategies. The paper contends that the model's enduring relevance\nlies in its adaptability. By recognizing both its limitations and its\nstrengths, and by understanding its integration within hybrid approaches,\npractitioners can make more informed decisions about methodology selection and\nprocess design in diverse development environments."}

Existing benchmarks predominantly target cultural knowledge\n(CulturalBench), value prediction (WorldValuesBench), or single-axis bias\ndiagnostics (CDEval); none evaluate how LLMs adjudicate when multiple\nculturally grounded values directly clash. We address this gap with CCD-Bench,\na benchmark that assesses LLM decision-making under cross-cultural value\nconflict. CCD-Bench comprises 2,182 open-ended dilemmas spanning seven domains,\neach paired with ten anonymized response options corresponding to the ten GLOBE\ncultural clusters. These dilemmas are presented using a stratified Latin square\nto mitigate ordering effects. We evaluate 17 non-reasoning LLMs. Models\ndisproportionately prefer Nordic Europe (mean 20.2 percent) and Germanic Europe\n(12.4 percent), while options for Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North\nAfrica are underrepresented (5.6 to 5.8 percent).

Ordering effects are negligible (Cramer's V less than 0.10), and\nsymmetrized KL divergence shows clustering by developer lineage rather than\ngeography.

However, its application in conversational AI is\nfundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic\ncomputational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.\nCurrent models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation\nhistory with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long\ndialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$.

This\ndifficulty is especially common when instructive prompts intertwine reasoning\ndirectives -- specifying what the model should solve -- with rigid formatting\nrequirements that dictate how the solution must be presented. The entanglement\ncreates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation\nof these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we\nintroduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format\nadherence from task solving. Deco-G handles format compliance with a separate\ntractable probabilistic model (TPM), while prompts LLMs with only task\ninstructions. At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities\nfrom the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the\noutput probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for\nmodern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:\ninstruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM\nstate pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDeco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including\nmathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction.

This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction\nprocess, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that\nachieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference.

In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a\ngeneralizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like\nreflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain\nthat includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering\nand decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases\nlarge language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without\nexternal retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables\ncost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled\ntraining examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable\nabsolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while\ncutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can\nlearn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and\nself-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive\ntask-specific fine-tuning data."}

We present a large language\nmodel (LLM)-based pipeline that infers Big Five personality traits and five\npatient-oriented subjective judgments. The analysis encompasses 4.1 million\npatient reviews of 226,999 U.S. physicians from an initial pool of one million.\nWe validate the method through multi-model comparison and human expert\nbenchmarking, achieving strong agreement between human and LLM assessments\n(correlation coefficients 0.72-0.89) and external validity through correlations\nwith patient satisfaction (r = 0.41-0.81, all p<0.001). National-scale analysis\nreveals systematic patterns: male physicians receive higher ratings across all\ntraits, with largest disparities in clinical competence perceptions;\nempathy-related traits predominate in pediatrics and psychiatry; and all traits\npositively predict overall satisfaction. Cluster analysis identifies four\ndistinct physician archetypes, from \"Well-Rounded Excellent\" (33.8%, uniformly\nhigh traits) to \"Underperforming\" (22.6%, consistently low).

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning\nframework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model\nwith simple pointwise rewards to establish fundamental scoring capabilities,\nthen transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and\nlistwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic\ndistinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward\n(PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each\nslice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides\na precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion,\nenabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization.

While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,\nthey ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for\nexample between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward \"I don't\nknow\" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness\nScore (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a\nmodel's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally\ndistinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty\nexpressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default\nrange.

However, variability in training\ndata can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper\nstudies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or\ntext to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural\ncharacteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model\nperformance. We hypothesize that alignment can be accurately estimated by\ncomparing the distributions of structural SQL features across the training set,\ntarget data, and the model's predictions prior to SFT. Through comprehensive\nexperiments on three large cross-domain NL2SQL benchmarks and multiple model\nfamilies, we show that structural alignment is a strong predictor of\nfine-tuning success. When alignment is high, SFT yields substantial gains in\naccuracy and SQL generation quality; when alignment is low, improvements are\nmarginal or absent. These findings highlight the importance of alignment-aware\ndata selection for effective fine-tuning and generalization in NL2SQL tasks."}

We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric\nframework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of\nhidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that\nrely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates\nintrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based\ncontrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth\nembeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in\nsemantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while\nhallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the\nTruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an\nF1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming\nSelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single\nforward pass.

The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task.

Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K.
