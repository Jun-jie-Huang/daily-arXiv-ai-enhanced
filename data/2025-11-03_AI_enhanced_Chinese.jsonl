However, best-intended practices for conducting empirical studies\nhave not yet well established. In this paper, based on the primary studies\nidentified from the latest systematic literature review on quantum optimization\nfor software engineering problems, we conducted a systematic analysis on these\nstudies from various aspects including experimental designs, hyperparameter\nsettings, case studies, baselines, tooling, and metrics. We identify key gaps\nin the current practices such as limited reporting of the number of\nrepetitions, number of shots, and inadequate consideration of noise handling,\nas well as a lack of standardized evaluation protocols such as the adoption of\nquality metrics, especially quantum-specific metrics. Based on our analysis, we\nprovide insights for designing empirical studies and highlight the need for\nmore real-world and open case studies to assess cost-effectiveness and\npractical utility of the three types of approaches: quantum-inspired, quantum,\nand hybrid.

The\nmethod builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge\nrepresentations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing\nand retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing\ncloser semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an\nuncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and\nfilter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model\nto maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false\ncontent.

We address this\nquestion by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS\nadopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any\nsignificant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.\nBy applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following\ninteresting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language\ndemonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new\nperiods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text\n(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and\nfurther confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the\nperiodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured\nfactors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The\nadvantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in\nLLM-generation detection are further discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS)\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5355\u7bc7\u6587\u6863\u7684\u60ca\u8bb6\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u5468\u671f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165APS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u5468\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u60ca\u8bb6\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8c10\u6ce2\u56de\u5f52\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5468\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5305\u62ec\u5e38\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u5355\u5143\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u540c\u65f6APS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each\nmemory component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6BEAM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe1000\u4e07\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8fde\u8d2f\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u914d\u5957\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efaBEAM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u77ed\u65f6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u79ef\u7d2f\u663e\u8457\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u677f\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u767e\u4e07\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.5%-12.69%\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cBEAM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this\nenvironment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable\ngains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.\nRemaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and\ncontextual understanding.\n  Code and datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/maokangkun/MedCalc-Eval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MedCalc-Eval\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6700\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e24\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684MedCalc-Env\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u533b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u51c6MedCalc-Eval\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883MedCalc-Env\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3Qwen2.5-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MedCalc-Eval\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Qwen2.5-32B\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3001\u516c\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\u53ca\u8bed\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "MedCalc-Eval\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u516c\u5f00\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While\nrecent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to\nexamine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could\nhelp mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range\nof detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be\nidentified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ea\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u624d\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5c06\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4f46\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ec5\u7ea620%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u9020\u6210\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but\nsubstantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label\nprojection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668TransAlign\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u5f71\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1TransAlign\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u9012\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "TransAlign\u5728\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u548c\u975e\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u5f71\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0cTransAlign\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage.

However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create\ngold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen\nconsultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five\nopen-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and\nQwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot\nprompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics.
